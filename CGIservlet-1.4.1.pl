# CGIservlet:
#         A HTTPd "connector" for running CGI scripts on unix systems as WWW
#         accessible Web sites. The servlet starts a true HTTP daemon that channels 
#         HTTP requests to forked daughter processes. CGIservlet.pl is NOT a
#         full fledged server. Moreover, this servlet is definitely NOT intended 
#         as a replacement of a real server (e.g., Apache). It's design goal was
#         SIMPLICITY, and not mileage. 
#         
#         Note that a HTTP server can be accessed on your local machine WITHOUT 
#         internet access (but WITH a DNS?): 
#         use "http://localhost[:port]/[path]" or "http://127.0.0.1[:port]/[path]" 
#         as the URL. It is also easy to restrict access to the servlet to localhost
#         users (i.e., the computer running the servlet).
#         
#         Suggested uses:
#         - A testbed for CGI-scripts and document-trees outside the primary server.
#           When developing new scripts and services, you don't want to mess up your
#           current Web-site. CGIservlet is an easy way to start a temporary (private) 
#           server. CGIservlet allows to test separate HTTP server components, e.g., 
#           user authentication, in isolation.
#           
#         - A special purpose temporary server (WWW everywhere/anytime). 
#           We run identification and other experiments over the inter-/intra-net using 
#           CGI-scripts. This means a lot of development and changes and only little
#           actual run-time. The people doing this do not want "scripting" access to our 
#           departmental server with all its restrictions and security. So we need a 
#           small, lightweigth, easy-to-configure server that can be run by each
#           investigator on her own account (and risk). 
#          
#         - Interactive WWW presentations.
#           Not everyone is content with the features of "standard" office presentation 
#           software. HTML and its associated browsers are an alternative (especially 
#           under Linux). However, you need a server to realize the full interactive 
#           nature of the WWW. CGIservlet with the necessary scripts can be run from 
#           a floppie (a Web server in 100 kB). The CGIservlet can actually run a 
#           (small) web site from RAM, without disk access (if you DO NOT use the 
#           2>pid.log redirection on startup). 
#           With the "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" id in your browser you can use the
#           servlet standalone.
#           
#         When the servlet is started with the -r option, only requests from "localhost" 
#         or "127.0.0.1" are accepted (default) or from addresses indicated after the
#         -r switch.
#

# 06 Jun 2012 - Added HTTP Cookie string to an Environment variable: COOKIE_JAR
# 29 May 2012 - Added .log -> / to @RegAliasTranslation, blocks attempts to read
#               log files.
# 22 May 2012 - Blocked "hidden" files and directories starting with "." in

# 22 Jul 2003 - Plain output using binary print io. `cat ...`
# 22 Jul 2003 - Added 'use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);' line
#               for debugging. Standard this is commented out
#               for security reasons (suggested by Jochen_Hayek@ACM.org).
# 22 Jul 2003 - Added error checking to doarg (suggested by Jochen_Hayek@ACM.org)
# 22 Jul 2003 - Removed SERVER_PORT from HTTP_HOST (Bug found by Jochen_Hayek@ACM.org)
# 22 Jul 2003 - Updated documentation. Added CGIservlet directory
#               to the search path of CGIservletSETUP.pl
# 20 May 2003 - Made sure recycled (double) pid's do not mess up the

#               security switch. With security toggled of
#               directories can be browsed and all mime-types
#               are served, either as 'text/plain' or as
#               'application/octed-stream'.
# 18 May 2001 - Added some HTTP HTTP lines.
# 13 Jun 2000 - Included the possibility to add POST request
#               to GET query-strings (and change the request
#               method). The -l ($Maxlength) maximum length
#               option now covers POST requests too.
#  8 Dec 1999 - Included hooks for compression when running from RAM. 
#  2 Dec 1999 - Autoflush enabled. 
#  2 Dec 1999 - Allow running a Web Site from RAM. 
#  2 Dec 1999 - Changed the behavior of CGIservletSETUP. CGIservlet

#                       without any scripts, implement a dynamic web server)
#               Linited to '.cgi' extension.
# 26 Nov 1999 - Added aliasing of URL paths, both one-to-one lookups
#                and full regular expression, i.e., $Path =~ s/.../.../g 
#                replace commands
# 28 Sep 1999 - Made all client supplied HTTP parameter names lowercase
#                       to handle inconsistencies in case use.
# 29 Jul 1999 - Allowed for a SETUP configuration file 'CGIservletSETUP.pl'.

# Known bugs
#
# 23 Mar 2000 - An odd server side network error is reported by Netscape
#               when a Post is initiated from a Javascript Submit of a 
#               <FORM>. This was found on Red Hat 6.1 Linux with perl 5.00503,
#               5.00503 and 5.6.0. But not on IRIX or Red Hat 5.0, 7.x.
#
############################################################################
# 
#         
# Inner workings:
#         Whenever an HTTP request is received, the specified CGI script is 
#         started inside a child process as if it was inside a real server (e.g., 
#         Apache). The evironment variables are set more or less as in Apache. 
#         Note that CGIservlet only uses a SINGLE script for ALL requests.
#         No attemps for security are made, it is the script's responsibility to 
#         check access rights and the validity of the request.
#         When no scripts are given, CGIservlet runs as a bare bone WWW server
#         configurable to execute scripts (the default setting is as a
#         STATIC server).

#
# Note:   CGIservlet.pl was directly inspired by Jerry LeVan's 
#         (levan@eagle.eku.edu) simple mhttpd server which again was 
#         inspired by work of others. CGIservlet is used as a bare bones 
#         socket server for a single CGI script at a time.
#
# Use:    CGIservlet.pl -<switch> <argument> 2>pid.log &     (sh/bash)
#         CGIservlet.pl -<switch> <argument> >&pid.log &     (csh)
#         
#         The servlet prints out pid and port number on STDERR. It is
#         adviced to store these in a separate file (this will become the
#         error log). 
#         NOTE: When running CGIservlet from a Memmory Image (i.e. RAM), 
#         do NOT redirect the error output to a file, but use something
#         like MAILTO or /dev/null!
#
# Stop:   sh pid.log                    (kills the server process)
#         
#         The first line in the file that receives STDERR output is a command
#         to stop CGIservlet.
#                 
#         examples:
#         CGIservlet.pl -p 2345 -d /cgi-bin/CGIscriptor.pl -t /WWW 2>pid.log &
#         CGIservlet.pl -p 8080 -b 'require "CGIscriptor.pl";' -t $PWD -e \
#         'Handle_Request();' 2>pid.log &
#         
#         The following example settings implement a static WWW server using 'cat'
#         (and prohibiting Queries):
#         -p 8008 
#         -t `pwd` 
#         -b ''
#         -e 
# '$ENV{QUERY_STRING}="";$ENV{PATH_INFO}=~/\.([\w]+)$/; "Content-type: ".$mimeType{uc($1)}."\n\n";'
#         -d 'cat -u -s'
#         -w '/index.html'
#         -c 32
#         -l 512
#         
#         This is identical to the (static) behaviour of CGIservlet when 
#         -e '' -d '' -x '' is used.
#         The CGIservlet command should be run from the intended server-root directory.
# 
#         Another setting will use a package 'CGIscriptor.pl' with a function
#         'HandleRequest()' to implement an interactive WWW server with inline 
#         Perl scripting:
#         -p 8080 
#         -t `pwd` 
#         -b 'require "CGIscriptor.pl";' 
#         -e 'HandleRequest();'
#         -d ''
#         -w '/index.html'
#         -c 32
#         -l 32767
#         
#         Look below or in the CGIservletSETUP.pl file for the current default 
#         settings.
#
#
# ###############################################################################
# 
#         There are many switches to tailor the workings of CGIservlet.pl.
#         Some are fairly esoteric and you should only look for them if you
#         need something special urgently. When building a Web site, 
#         the specific options you need will "suggest" themselves (e.g., port
#         number, script, or server-root directory). Most default settings 
#         should work fine. 
#
#         You can add your own configuration in a file called
#         'CGIservletSETUP.pl'. This file will be executed ("eval"-ed) 
#         after the default setup, but before the command line options take 
#         effect. CGIservlet looks for the SETUP file in the startup directory
#         and in the CGIscriptor subdirectory.
#         (Note that the $beginarg variable is evaluated AFTER the setup file). 
#         
#         In any case, it is best to change the default settings instead of
#         using the option switches. All defaults are put in a single block.
#          
#         switches and arguments:
#         Realy important
#         -p[ort] port number 
#          For example -p 2345
#          Obviously the port CGIservlet listenes to. Suggested Default: -p 8008
#          
#         -a[lias] Alias1 RealURL1 ...
#          For example -a '/Stimulus.aifc' '/catAIFC.xmr'
#          Replaces the given Alias URL path by its real URL path. Accepts full 
#          regular expressions too (identified by NON-URL characters). 
#          That is, on each request it performs (in order):
#          if($AliasTranslation{$Path})
#          { 
#              $Path = $AliasTranslation{$Path};
#          }
#          elsif(@RegAliasTranslation)
#          {  
#             my $i;
#             for($i=0; $i<scalar(@RegAliasTranslation); ++$i)
#             { 
#                 my $Alias   = $RegAliasTranslation[$i];
#                 my $RealURL = $RegURLTranslation[$i];
#                 last if ($Path =~ s#$Alias#$RealURL#g);
#             };
#          };
#          The effects can be quite drastic, so be 
#          carefull. Note also, that entering many Regular Expression
#          aliases could slow down your servlet. Checking stops after 
#          the first match.
#          Full regular expression alias translations are done in the
#          order given! They are recognized as Aliases containing 
#          regexp's (i.e., non-URL) operator characters like '^' and
#          '$'.
#          Note: The command line is NOT a good place for entering
#          Aliases, change the code below or add aliases to 
#          CGIservletSETUP.pl.
#
#         --help
#          Prints the manual
#          
#         Script related
#         -b[egin] perl commands
#          For example -b 'require "CGIscriptor.pl";' or
#          'require "/WWW/cgi-bin/XMLelement.pl";'
#          Perl commands evaluated at server startup
#          
#         -d[o] perl script file
#          For example -d '/WWW/cgi-bin/CGIscriptor.pl'
#          The actual CGI-script started as a perl {do "scriptfile"} command.
#          The PATH_INFO and the QUERY are pushed on @ARGV.
#          
#         -x shell command
#         -qx shell command
#         -exec shell command
#          OS shell script or command, e.g., -x 'CGIscriptor.pl' or 
#          -x '/WWW/cgi-bin/my-script'
#          The actual CGI-script started as `my-script \'$Path\' \'$QueryString\'`. 
#          -qx and -exec[ute] are aliases of -x. For security reasons, Paths or
#          queries containing '-quotes are rejected.
#          
#         -e[val] perl commands
#          For example -e 'Handle_Request();'   
#          The argument is evaluated as perl code. The actual CGI-script 
#          can be loaded once with -b 'require module.pm' and you only have to 
#          call the central function(s).
#          
#         WWW-tree related
#         -t[extroot] path
#          For example -t "$PWD" or -t "/WWW/documents"
#          The root of the server hierachy. Defaults to the working directory
#          at startup time (`pwd`)  
#          
#         -w[elcome] filepath
#          For example -w "/index.html"   (default)
#          The default welcome page used when no path is entered. Note that
#          this path can point to anything (or nothing real at all).
#         
#         Security related
#         The following arguments supply some rudimentary security. It is the
#         responsibility of the script to ensure that the requests are indeed
#         "legal".
#
#         -c[hildren] maximum child processes
#          For example -c 32
#          The maximum number of subprocesses started. If there are more requests,
#          the oldest requests are "killed". This should take care of "zombie"
#          processes and server overloading. Note that new requests will be 
#          serviced irrespective of the success of killing it's older siblings.
#          
#         -xtime maximum running time of a child
#          For example -xtime 36000
#          The maximum time a child may run in seconds. After a new request has 
#          been servised, all children that have run for longer than this time 
#          will be killed. This stops runaway processes, often connected to
#          web-crawlers. 
#          
#         -l[ength] maximum length of HTTP request in bytes
#          For example -l 32768 
#          This prevents overloading the server with enormous queries. Reading of
#          requests simply stops when this limit is reached. This DOES affect 
#          POST requests.  If the combined length of the COMPLETE HTTP request,
#          including headers, exceeds this limit, the whole request is dropped.
#          
#         -r[estrict] [Remote-address [Remote-host]]
#          For example -r 127.0.0.1          (default of -r)
#          A space separated list of client IP addresses and/or domain names that
#          should be serviced. Default, i.e., '-r' without any addresses or domain
#          names, is the localhost IP address '127.0.0.1'.
#          When using CGIservlet for local purposes only (e.g., development or a 
#          presentation), it would be unsafe to allow others to access the servlet.
#          If -r is used (or the corresponding @RemoteAddr or @RemoteHost lists are
#          filled in the code below), all requests from clients whose Remote-address
#          or Remote-host do not match the indicated addresses will be rejected.
#          Partial addresses and domain names are allowed. Matching is done according 
#          to Remote-addr =~ /^\Q$pattern\E/ (front to back) and 
#          Remote-host =~ /\Q$pattern\E$/ (back to front)
#
#          --env name=value,name=value
#          Watch double dash. Define $ENV{name}=value for every pair. These are 
#          internally stored in %UserEnv, eg, $UserEnv{name}=value; This is set anew 
#          in the Child with every request. That is, Changes in %ENV are not stored.
# 
#         -s[ecure] 
#          No arguments.
#          A toggle switch that blocks all access to files with undefined
#          mime-types (or to serve ascii files as "text/plain"), and blocking directory 
#          browsing. Defaults to blocking what is not explicitely allowed.
#
#         -m[emory]
#          No arguments.
#          Reads complete Web site into memory and runs from this image.
#          Set $UseRAMimage = 1; to activate memory-only running.
#          Under certain circumstance, this can improve security.
#          Note, however, that running osshellscripts from this image 
#          makes any "security" related claims very shaky.
#          
#         Speedup
#         -n[oname]
#          No arguments. 
#          Retrieving the domain name of the Client (i.e., Remote-host) is a
#          very slow process and normally useless. To skip it, enter this 
#          option. Note that you cannot use '-r Remote-host' anymore after 
#          you enter -n, only IP addresses will work.
#
#     Configuration with the CGIservletSETUP.pl file
#
#     You can add your own configuration in a file
#     called 'CGIservletSETUP.pl'. This file will be executed ("eval"-ed) 
#     after the default setup, but before the command line options take 
#     effect. CGIservlet looks for the SETUP file in the startup directory
#     and in the CGIservlet and CGIscriptor subdirectories.
#     (Note that the $beginarg variable is evaluated even later).
#
#         Changing POST to GET requests
#
#         CGIservlet normally only handles requests with the GET method. Processing
#         the input from POST requests is left to the reading application. POST 
#         requests add some extra complexity to processing requests. Sometimes,
#         the reading application doesn't handle POST requests. CGIservlet
#         already has to manage the HTTP request. Therefore, it can easily
#         handle the POST request. If the variable $POSTtoGET is set to any
#         non-false value, the content of whole POST request is added to the
#         QUERY_STRING environment variable (preceeded by a '&' if necessary).
#         The content-length is set to 0. If $POSTtoGET equals 'GET', the method 
#         will also be changed to 'GET'.

#          remarks:
#          All of the arguments of -d, -e, and -x are processed sequentially
#          in this order. This might not be what you want so you should be 
#          carefull when using multiple executable arguments.
#          If none of the executable arguments is DEFINED (i.e., they are entered
#          as -d '' -e '' -x ''), each request is treated as a simple 
#          text-retrieval. THIS CAN BE A SECURITY RISK!
#          
#          The wiring of an interactive web-server, which also calls shell 
#          scripts with the extension '.cgi', is in place. You can 
#          "activate" it by changing the "my $ExecuteOSshell = 0;" line to 
#          "my $ExecuteOSshell = 1;".
#          If you have trouble doing this, it might be a good idea
#          to reconsider using a dynamic web server. Executing shell
#          scripts inside a web server is a rather dangerous practise.
#
#          CGIservlet can run its "standard" web server from memory. 
#          At startup, all files are read into a hash table. Upon
#          request, the contents of the file are placed in the
#          environment variable: CGI_FILE_CONTENTS.
#          No further disk access is necessary. This means that:
#          1 CGIservlet can run a WWW site from a removable disk, 
#            e.g., a floppy
#          2 The web servlet can run without any read or write privilege.
#          3 The integrity of the Web-site contents can be secured at the
#            level you want
#
#          To compres the memory (RAM) immage, you should hook the 
#          compression function to 
#          $CompressRAMimage = sub { return shift;};
#          and the decompression function to
#          $DecompressRAMimage = sub { return shift;};

=head1 NAME

CGIservlet - a HTTPd "connector" for running CGI scripts on unix systems as WWW
accessible Web sites. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The servlet starts a true HTTP daemon that channels 
HTTP requests to forked daughter processes. Can run 
a (small) WWW-site from memory.
 
=head1 README

Whenever an HTTP request is received, the specified CGI script is 
started inside a child process as if it was inside a real server (e.g., 
Apache). The evironment variables are set more or less as in Apache. 
Note that CGIservlet only uses a SINGLE script for ALL requests.
No attemps for security are made, it is the script's responsibility to 
check access rights and the validity of the request.
Can store the files of Web site in memory and serve them
on request.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

This script requires the C<strict>, Socket and Carp modules.
