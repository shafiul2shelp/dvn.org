# CGIscriptor.pl is a Perl program will run on any WWW server that 
# runs Perl scripts, just add a line like the following to your  
# httpd.conf file (Apache example):
# 
# ScriptAlias /SHTML/ "/real-path/CGIscriptor.pl/"
# 
# URL's that refer to http://www.your.address/SHTML/... will now be handled 
# by CGIscriptor.pl, which can use a private directory tree (default is the 
# DOCUMENT_ROOT directory tree, but it can be anywhere, see below).
# NOTE: if you cannot use a ScriptAlias, there is a way to use .htaccess
# instead. See below.
# 
# This file contains all documentation as comments. These comments
# can be removed to speed up loading (e.g., `egrep -v '^#' CGIscriptor.pl` > 
# leanScriptor.pl). A bare bones version of CGIscriptor.pl, lacking
# documentation, most comments, access control, example functions etc.
# (but still with the copyright notice and some minimal documentation)
# can be obtained by calling CGIscriptor.pl with the '-slim'
# command line argument, e.g.,
# >CGIscriptor.pl -slim >slimCGIscriptor.pl
# 
# CGIscriptor.pl can be run from the command line as 
# `CGIscriptor.pl <path> <query>`, inside a perl script with 
# 'do CGIscriptor.pl' after setting $ENV{PATH_INFO} and $ENV{QUERY_STRING}, 
# or CGIscriptor.pl can be loaded with 'require "/real-path/CGIscriptor.pl"'. 
# In the latter case, requests are processed by 'Handle_Request();' 
# (again after setting $ENV{PATH_INFO} and $ENV{QUERY_STRING}).
# 
# The --help command line switch will print the manual. 
# 
# Running demo's and more information can be found at 
# http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/OSS/OSS.html
#         
# A pocket-size HTTP daemon, CGIservlet.pl, is available from my web site
# or CPAN that can use CGIscriptor.pl as the base of a µWWW server and 
# demonstrates its use.

############################################################################
#
# Changes (document ALL changes with date, name and email here):
# 05 Apr  2013 - Renamed COOKIE_JAR to HTTP_COOKIE, added support for 
#                CGI::Cookie in case $ENV{HTTP_COOKIE} is undefined (untested)

# 13 Mar  2013 - Changed password hash
# 10 Jul  2012 - Version 2.4
# 11 Jun  2012 - Securing CGIvariable setting. Made 
#                'if($ENV{QUERY_STRING} =~ /$name/)' into elsif in
#                defineCGIvariable/List/Hash to give precedence to ENV{$name}
#                This was a very old security bug. Added ProtectCGIvariable($name). 
# 06 Jun  2012 - Added IP only session types after login.
# 31 May  2012 - Session ticket system added for handling login sessions.
# 29 May  2012 - CGIsafeFileName does not accept filenames starting with '.'
# 29 May  2012 - Added CGIscriptor::BrowseAllDirs to handle browsing directories
#                correctly.
# 22 May  2012 - Added Access control with Session Tickets linked to 
#                IP Address and PATH_INFO.
# 21 May  2012 - Corrected the links generated by CGIscriptor::BrowseDirs
#                Will link to current base URL when the HTTP server is '.' or '~'
# 29 Oct  2009 - Adapted David A. Wheeler's suggestion about filenames: 
#                CGIsafeFileName does not accept filenames starting with '-'
#                (http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html)
# 08 Oct  2009 - Some corrections in the README.txt file, eg, new email address
# 28 Jan  2005 - Added a file selector to performTranslation.
#                Changed %TranslationTable to @TranslationTable
#                and patterns to lists.
# 27 Jan  2005 - Added a %TranslationTable with associated 
#                performTranslation(\$text) function to allow
#                run changes in the web pages. Say, to translate
#                legacy pages with <%=...%> delimiters to the new 
#                <SCRIPT TYPE=..></SCRIPT> format.
# 27 Jan  2005 - Small bug of extra '\n' in output removed from the 
#                Other Languages Code.
# 10 May  2004 - Belated upload of latest version (2.3) to CPAN
# 07 Oct  2003 - Corrected error '\s' -> '\\s' in rebol scripting
#                language call
# 07 Oct  2003 - Corrected omitted INS tags in <DIV><INS> handling
# 20 May  2003 - Added a --help switch to print the manual.
# 06 Mar  2003 - Adapted the blurb at the end of the file.
# 03 Mar  2003 - Added a user definable dieHandler function to catch all
#                "die" calls. Also "enhanced" the STDERR printout.
# 10 Feb  2003 - Split off the reading of the POST part of a query
#                from Initialize_output. This was suggested by Gerd Franke 
#                to allow for the catching of the file_path using a
#                POST based lookup. That is, he needed the POST part
#                to change the file_path.
# 03 Feb  2003 - %{$name}; => %{$name} = (); in defineCGIvariableHash.
# 03 Feb  2003 - \1 better written as $1 in 
#                $directive =~ s/[^\\\$]\#[^\n\f\r]*([\n\f\r])/$1/g 
# 29 Jan  2003 - This makes "CLASS="ssperl" CSS-compatible  Gerd Franke
#                added: 
#                $ServerScriptContentClass = "ssperl";
#                changed in ProcessFile():
#                unless(($CurrentContentType =~
# 28 Jan  2003 - Added 'INS' Tag!  Gerd Franke
# 20 Dec  2002 - Removed useless $Directoryseparator variable.
#                Update comments and documentation.
# 18 Dec  2002 - Corrected bug in Accept/Reject processing. 
#                Files didn't work.
# 24 Jul  2002 - Added .htaccess documentation (from Gerd Franke)
#                Also added a note that RawFilePattern can be a
#                complete file name.
# 19 Mar  2002 - Added SRC pseudo-files PREFIX and POSTFIX. These
#                switch to prepending or to appending the content
#                of the SRC attribute. Default is prefixing. You
#                can add as many of these switches as you like.
# 13 Mar  2002 - Do not search for tag content if a tag closes with
#                />, i.e., <DIV ... /> will be handled the XML/XHTML way.
# 25 Jan  2002 - Added 'curl' and 'snarf' to SRC attribute URL handling 
#                (replaces wget).
# 25 Jan  2002 - Found a bug in SAFEqx, now executes qx() in a scalar context
#                (i.o. a list context). This is necessary for binary results.
# 24 Jan  2002 - Disambiguated -T $SRCfile to -T "$SRCfile" (and -e) and
#                changed the order of if/elsif to allow removing these 
#                conditions in systems with broken -T functions.
#                (I also removed a spurious ')' bracket)
# 17 Jan  2002 - Changed DIV tag SRC from <SOURCE> to sysread(SOURCE,...)
#                to support binary files.
# 17 Jan  2002 - Removed WhiteSpace from $FileAllowedCharacters.
# 17 Jan  2002 - Allow "file://" prefix in SRC attribute. It is simply
#                stipped from the path.
# 15 Jan  2002 - Version 2.2
# 15 Jan  2002 - Debugged and completed URL support (including 
#                CGIscriptor::read_url() function)
# 07 Jan  2002 - Added automatic (magic) URL support to the SRC attribute 
#                with the main::GET_URL function. Uses wget -O underlying.
# 04 Jan  2002 - Added initialization of $NewDirective in InsertForeignScript
#                (i.e., my $NewDirective = "";) to clear old output
#                (this was a realy anoying bug).
# 03 Jan  2002 - Added a <DIV CLASS='text/ssperl' ID='varname'></DIV> 
#                tags that assign the body text as-is (literally)
#                to $varname. Allows standard HTML-tools to handle
#                Cascading Style Sheet templates. This implements a
#                design by Gerd Franke (franke@roo.de).
# 03 Jan  2002 - I finaly gave in and allowed SRC files to expand ~/.
# 12 Oct  2001 - Normalized spelling of "CGIsafFileName" in documentation.
# 09 Oct  2001 - Added $ENV{'CGI_BINARY_FILE'} to log files to 
#                detect unwanted indexing of TAR files by webcrawlers.
# 10 Sep  2001 - Added $YOUR_SCRIPTS directory to @INC for 'require'.
# 22 Aug  2001 - Added .txt (Content-type: text/plain) as a default 
#                processed file type. Was processed via BinaryMapFile.
# 31 May  2001 - Changed =~ inside CGIsafeEmailAddress that was buggy.
# 29 May  2001 - Updated $CGI_HOME to point to $ENV{DOCUMENT_ROOT} io
#                the root of PATH_TRANSLATED. DOCUMENT_ROOT can now
#                be manipulated to achieve a "Sub Root". 
#                NOTE: you can have $YOUR_HTML_FILES != DOCUMENT_ROOT
# 28 May  2001 - Changed CGIscriptor::BrowsDirs function for security
#                and debugging (it now works).
# 21 May  2001 - defineCGIvariableHash will ADD values to existing
#                hashes,instead of replacing existing hashes.
# 17 May  2001 - Interjected a '&' when pasting POST to GET data
# 24 Apr  2001 - Blocked direct requests for BinaryMapFile. 
# 16 Aug  2000 - Added hash table extraction for CGI parameters with 
#                CGIparseValueHash (used with structured parameters).
#                Use: CGI='%<CGI-partial-name>' (fill in your name in <>)
#                Will collect all <CGI-partial-name><key>=value pairs in
#                $<CGI-partial-name>{<key>} = value;
# 16 Aug  2000 - Adapted SAFEqx to protect @PARAMETER values.
# 09 Aug  2000 - Added support for non-filesystem input by way of
#                the CGI_FILE_CONTENTS and CGI_DATA_ACCESS_CODE
#                environment variables.
# 26 Jul  2000 - On the command-line, file-path '-' indicates STDIN.
#                This allows CGIscriptor to be used in pipes.
#                Default, $BLOCK_STDIN_HTTP_REQUEST=1 will block this
#                in an HTTP request (i.e., in a web server).
# 26 Jul  2000 - Blocked 'Content-type: text/html' if the SERVER_PROTOCOL
#                is not HTTP or another protocol. Changed the default
#                source directory to DOCUMENT_ROOT (i.o. the incorrect
#                SERVER_ROOT).
# 24 Jul  2000 - -slim Command-line argument added to remove all
#                comments, security, etc.. Updated documentation.
# 05 Jul  2000 - Added IF and UNLESS attributes to make the
#                execution of all <META> and <SCRIPT> code
#                conditional.
# 05 Jul  2000 - Rewrote and isolated the code for extracting
#                quoted items from CGI and SRC attributes.
#                Now all attributes expect the same set of
#                quotes: '', "", ``, (), {}, [] and the same
#                preceded by a \, e.g., "\((aap)\)" will be 
#                extracted as "(aap)".
# 17 Jun  2000 - Construct @ARGV list directly in CGIexecute
#                name-space (i.o. by evaluation) from
#                CGI attributes to prevent interference with
#                the processing for non perl scripts.
#                Changed CGIparseValueList to prevent runaway
#                loops.
# 16 Jun  2000 - Added a direct (interpolated) display mode
#                (text/ssdisplay) and a user log mode
#                (text/sslogfile).
# 06 Jun  2000 - Replace "print $Result" with a syswrite loop to
#                allow large string output.
# 02 Jun  2000 - Corrected shrubCGIparameter($CGI_VALUE) to realy
#                remove all control characters. Changed Interpreter
#                initialization to shrub interpolated CGI parameters.
#                Added  'text/ssmailto' interpreter script.
# 22 May  2000 - Changed some of the comments
# 09 May  2000 - Added list extraction for CGI parameters with 
#                CGIparseValueList (used with multiple selections).
#                Use: CGI='@<CGI-parameter>' (fill in your name in <>)
# 09 May  2000 - Added a 'Not Present' condition to CGIparseValue.
# 27 Apr  2000 - Updated documentation to reflect changes.
# 27 Apr  2000 - SRC attribute "cleaned". Supported for external
#                interpreters.
# 27 Apr  2000 - CGI attribute can be used in <SCRIPT> tag.
# 27 Apr  2000 - Gprolog, M4 support added.
# 26 Apr  2000 - Lisp (rep) support added.
# 20 Apr  2000 - Use of external interpreters now functional.
# 20 Apr  2000 - Removed bug from extracting Content types (RegExp)
# 10 Mar  2000 - Qualified unconditional removal of '#' that preclude
#                the use of $#foo, i.e., I changed
#                s/[^\\]\#[^\n\f\r]*([\n\f\r])/\1/g
#                to
#                s/[^\\\$]\#[^\n\f\r]*([\n\f\r])/\1/g
# 03 Mar  2000 - Added a '$BlockPathAccess' variable to "hide" 
#                things like, e.g., CVS information in CVS subtrees
# 10 Feb  2000 - URLencode/URLdecode have been made case-insensitive
# 10 Feb  2000 - Added a BrowseDirs function (CGIscriptor package)
# 01 Feb  2000 - A BinaryMapFile in the ~/ directory has precedence
#                over a "burried" BinaryMapFile.
# 04 Oct  1999 - Added two functions to check file names and email addresses
#                (CGIscriptor::CGIsafeFileName and 
#                 CGIscriptor::CGIsafeEmailAddress)
# 28 Sept 1999 - Corrected bug in sysread call for reading POST method 
#                to allow LONG posts.
# 28 Sept 1999 - Changed CGIparseValue to handle multipart/form-data.
# 29 July 1999 - Refer to BinaryMapFile from CGIscriptor directory, if
#                this directory exists.
# 07 June 1999 - Limit file-pattern matching to LAST extension
# 04 June 1999 - Default text/html content type is printed only once.
# 18 May  1999 - Bug in replacement of ~/ and ./ removed.
#                (Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
# 15 May  1999 - Changed the name of the execute package to CGIexecute.
#                Changed the processing of the Accept and Reject file.
#                Added a full expression evaluation to Access Control.
#                (Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
# 27 Apr  1999 - Brought CGIscriptor under the GNU GPL. Made CGIscriptor 
# Version 1.1    a module that can be called with 'require "CGIscriptor.pl"'.
#                Requests are serviced by "Handle_Request()". CGIscriptor 
#                can still be called as a isolated perl script and a shell
#                command. 
#                Changed the "factory default setting" so that it will run
#                from the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory.
#                (Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
# 29 Mar  1999 - Remove second debugging STDERR switch. Moved most code
#                to subroutines to change CGIscriptor into a module.
#                Added mapping to process unsupported file types (e.g., binary
#                pictures). See $BinaryMapFile.
#                (Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
# 24 Sept 1998 - Changed text of license (Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
#                Removed a double setting of filepatterns and maximum query 
#                size. Changed email address. Removed some typos from the
#                comments.
# 02 June 1998 - Bug fixed in URLdecode. Changing the foreach loop variable
#                caused quiting CGIscriptor.(Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
# 02 June 1998 - $SS_PUB and $SS_SCRIPT inserted an extra /, removed.
#                (Rob van Son, R.J.J.H.vanSon@gmail.com)
# 
#
# Known Bugs:
# 
# 23 Mar 2000
# It is not possible to use operators or variables to construct variable names, 
# e.g., $bar = \@{$foo}; won't work. However, eval('$bar = \@{'.$foo.'};'); 
# will indeed work. If someone could tell me why, I would be obliged.

# HYPE
#
# CGIscriptor merges plain ASCII HTML files transparantly and safely 
# with CGI variables, in-line PERL code, shell commands, and executable 
# scripts in many languages (on-line and real-time). It combines the 
# "ease of use" of HTML files with the versatillity of specialized 
# scripts and PERL programs. It hides all the specifics and 
# idiosyncrasies of correct output and CGI coding and naming. Scripts 
# do not have to be aware of HTML, HTTP, or CGI conventions just as HTML 
# files can be ignorant of scripts and the associated values. CGIscriptor 
# complies with the W3C HTML 4.0 recommendations.
# In addition to its use as a WWW embeded CGI processor, it can
# be used as a command-line document preprocessor (text-filter).
#
# THIS IS HOW IT WORKS
#
# The aim of CGIscriptor is to execute "plain" scripts inside a text file
# using any required CGIparameters and environment variables. It 
# is optimized to transparantly process HTML files inside a WWW server.
# The native language is Perl, but many other scripting languages
# can be used.
# 
# CGIscriptor reads text files from the requested input file (i.e., from
# $YOUR_HTML_FILES$PATH_INFO) and writes them to <STDOUT> (i.e., the 
# client requesting the service) preceded by the obligatory 
# "Content-type: text/html\n\n" or "Content-type: text/plain\n\n" string
# (except for "raw" files which supply their own Content-type message
# and only if the SERVER_PROTOCOL supports HTTP, MAIL, or MIME).
#
# When CGIscriptor encounters an embedded script, indicated by an HTML4 tag
#
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl" [CGI="$VAR='default value'"] [SRC="ScriptSource"]>
# PERL script
# </SCRIPT> 
#
# or
# 
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/osshell" [CGI="$name='default value'"] [SRC="ScriptSource"]>
# OS Shell script
# </SCRIPT> 
# 
# construct (anything between []-brackets is optional, other MIME-types
# and scripting languages are supported), the embedded script is removed 
# and both the contents of the source file (i.e., "do 'ScriptSource'") 
# AND the script are evaluated as a PERL program (i.e., by eval()), 
# shell script (i.e., by a "safe" version of `Command`, qx) or an external 
# interpreter. The output of the eval() function takes the place of the 
# original <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> construct in the output string. Any CGI 
# parameters declared by the CGI attribute are available as simple perl 
# variables, and can subsequently be made available as variables to other 
# scripting languages (e.g., bash, python, or lisp).
# 
# Example: printing "Hello World"
# <HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Hello World</TITLE>
# <BODY>
# <H1><SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">"Hello World"</SCRIPT></H1>
# </BODY></HTML>
# 
# Save this in a file, hello.html, in the directory you indicated with 
# $YOUR_HTML_FILES and access http://your_server/SHTML/hello.html
# (or to whatever name you use as an alias for CGIscriptor.pl). 
# This is realy ALL you need to do to get going.
# 
# You can use any values that are delivered in CGI-compliant form (i.e., 
# the "?name=value" type URL additions) transparently as "$name" variables 
# in your scripts IFF you have declared them in the CGI attribute of 
# a META or SCRIPT tag before e.g.:
# <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI='$name = `default value`' 
# [SRC='ScriptSource']"> 
# or
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl" CGI="$name = 'default value'" 
# [SRC='ScriptSource']> 
# After such a 'CGI' attribute, you can use $name as an ordinary PERL variable
# (the ScriptSource file is immediately evaluated with "do 'ScriptSource'"). 
# The CGIscriptor script allows you to write ordinary HTML files which will 
# include dynamic CGI aware (run time) features, such as on-line answers 
# to specific CGI requests, queries, or the results of calculations. 
#
# For example, if you wanted to answer questions of clients, you could write 
# a Perl program called "Answer.pl" with a function "AnswerQuestion()"
# that prints out the answer to requests given as arguments. You then write 
# an HTML page "Respond.html" containing the following fragment:
#
# <center>
# The Answer to your question
# <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI='$Question'">
# <h3><SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">$Question</SCRIPT></h3>
# is 
# <h3><SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl" SRC="./PATH/Answer.pl">
#  AnswerQuestion($Question);
# </SCRIPT></h3>
# </center>
# <FORM ACTION=Respond.html METHOD=GET>
# Next question: <INPUT NAME="Question" TYPE=TEXT SIZE=40><br>
# <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Ask">
# </FORM>
#
# The output could look like the following (in HTML-speak):
# 
# <CENTER>
# The Answer to your question
# <h3>What is the capital of the Netherlands?</h3>
# is
# <h3>Amsterdam</h3>
# </CENTER>
# <FORM ACTION=Respond.html METHOD=GET>
# Next question: <INPUT NAME="Question" TYPE=TEXT SIZE=40><br>
# <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Ask">
#
# Note that the function "Answer.pl" does know nothing about CGI or HTML,
# it just prints out answers to arguments. Likewise, the text has no 
# provisions for scripts or CGI like constructs. Also, it is completely 
# trivial to extend this "program" to use the "Answer" later in the page 
# to call up other information or pictures/sounds. The final text never 
# shows any cue as to what the original "source" looked like, i.e., 
# where you store your scripts and how they are called.
# 
# There are some extra's. The argument of the files called in a SRC= tag 
# can access the CGI variables declared in the preceding META tag from
# the @ARGV array. Executable files are called as: 
# `file '$ARGV[0]' ... ` (e.g., `Answer.pl \'$Question\'`;)
# The files called from SRC can even be (CGIscriptor) html files which are 
# processed in-line. Furthermore, the SRC= tag can contain a perl block 
# that is evaluated. That is, 
# <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI='$Question' SRC='{$Question}'">
# will result in the evaluation of "print do {$Question};" and the VALUE
# of $Question will be printed. Note that these "SRC-blocks" can be 
# preceded and followed by other file names, but only a single block is 
# allowed in a SRC= tag.
# 
# One of the major hassles of dynamic WWW pages is the fact that several
# mutually incompatible browsers and platforms must be supported. For example,
# the way sound is played automatically is different for Netscape and 
# Internet Explorer, and for each browser it is different again on 
# Unix, MacOS, and Windows. Realy dangerous is processing user-supplied 
# (form-) values to construct email addresses, file names, or database
# queries. All Apache WWW-server exploits reported in the media are 
# based on faulty CGI-scripts that didn't check their user-data properly.
#
# There is no panacee for these problems, but a lot of work and problems
# can be saved by allowing easy and transparent control over which 
# <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> blocks are executed on what CGI-data. CGIscriptor
# supplies such a method in the form of a pair of attributes:
# IF='...condition..' and UNLESS='...condition...'. When added to a
# script tag, the whole block (including the SRC attribute) will be
# ignored if the condition is false (IF) or true (UNLESS).
# For example, the following block will NOT be evaluated if the value
# of the CGI variable FILENAME is NOT a valid filename:
#
# <SCRIPT TYPE='text/ssperl' CGI='$FILENAME' 
# IF='CGIscriptor::CGIsafeFileName($FILENAME)'>
# .....
# </SCRIPT>
#
# (the function CGIsafeFileName(String) returns an empty string ("") 
# if the String argument is not a valid filename).
# The UNLESS attribute is the mirror image of IF.
#
# A user manual follows the HTML 4 and security paragraphs below.
# 
##########################################################################
#
# HTML 4 compliance
# 
# In general, CGIscriptor.pl complies with the HTML 4 recommendations of 
# the W3C. This means that any software to manage Web sites will be able
# to handle CGIscriptor files, as will web agents.
# 
# All script code should be placed between <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> tags, the 
# script type is indicated with TYPE="mime-type", the LANGUAGE
# feature is ignored, and a SRC feature is implemented. All CGI specific
# features are delegated to the CGI attribute.
# 
# However, the behavior deviates from the W3C recommendations at some 
# points. Most notably:
#  0- The scripts are executed at the server side, invissible to the 
#     client (i.e., the browser)
#  1- The mime-types are personal and idiosyncratic, but can be adapted.
#  2- Code in the body of a <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> tag-pair is still evaluated 
#     when a SRC feature is present.
#  3- The SRC attribute reads a list of files.
#  4- The files in a SRC attribute are processed according to file type.
#  5- The SRC attribute evaluates inline Perl code.
#  6- Processed META, DIV, INS tags are removed from the output 
#     document.
#  7- All attributes of the processed META tags, except CONTENT, are ignored 
#     (i.e., deleted from the output).
#  8- META tags can be placed ANYWHERE in the document.
#  9- Through the SRC feature, META tags can have visible output in the 
#     document.
# 10- The CGI attribute that declares CGI parameters, can be used
#     inside the <SCRIPT> tag.
# 11- Use of an extended quote set, i.e., '', "", ``, (), {}, []
#     and their \-slashed combinations: \'\', \"\", \`\`, \(\), 
#     \{\}, \[\].
# 12- IF and UNLESS attributes to <SCRIPT>, <META>, <DIV>, <INS> tags.
# 13- <DIV> tags cannot be nested, DIV tags are not
#     rendered with new-lines.
# 14- The XML style <TAG .... /> is recognized and handled correctly.
#     (i.e., no content is processed)
#    
# The reasons for these choices are:
# You can still write completely HTML4 compliant documents. CGIscriptor 
# will not force you to write "deviant" code. However, it allows you to 
# do so (which is, in fact, just as bad). The prime design principle 
# was to allow users to include plain Perl code. The code itself should 
# be "enhancement free". Therefore, extra features were needed to 
# supply easy access to CGI and Web site components. For security 
# reasons these have to be declared explicitly. The SRC feature 
# transparently manages access to external files, especially the safe 
# use of executable files. 
# The CGI attribute handles the declarations of external (CGI) variables
# in the SCRIPT and META tag's.
# EVERYTHING THE CGI ATTRIBUTE AND THE META TAG DO CAN BE DONE INSIDE 
# A <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> TAG CONSTRUCT.
# 
# The reason for the IF, UNLESS, and SRC attributes (and their Perl code 
# evaluation) were build into the META and SCRIPT tags is part laziness, 
# part security. The SRC blocks allows more compact documents and easier 
# debugging. The values of the CGI variables can be immediately screened 
# for security by IF or UNLESS conditions, and even SRC attributes (e.g., 
# email addresses and file names), and a few commands can be called 
# without having to add another Perl TAG pair. This is especially important
# for documents that require the use of other (more restricted) "scripting"
# languages and facilities that lag transparent control structures.

#   of the output distinguish it from the output of a plain, fixed HTML
#   file. Names, structures, and arguments of the "embedded" scripts 
#   are invisible to the client. Error output is suppressed except
#   during debugging (user configurable).
#
# 2 Separate directory trees
#   Directories containing Inline text and script files can reside on
#   separate trees, distinct from those of the HTTP server. This means
#   that NEITHER the text files, NOR the script files can be read by
#   clients other than through CGIscriptor.pl, UNLESS they are 
#   EXPLICITELY made available. 
#
# 3 Requests are NEVER "evaluated"
#   All client supplied values are used as literal values (''-quoted). 
#   Client supplied ''-quotes are ALWAYS removed. Therefore, as long as the 
#   embedded scripts do NOT themselves evaluate these values, clients CANNOT 
#   supply executable commands. Be sure to AVOID scripts like:
#   
#   <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI='$UserValue'">
#   <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">$dir = `ls -1 $UserValue`;</SCRIPT>
#   
#   These are a recipe for disaster. However, the following quoted
#   form should be save (but is still not adviced):
#   
#   <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">$dir = `ls -1 \'$UserValue\'`;</SCRIPT>
#   
#   A special function, SAFEqx(), will automatically do exactly this, 
#   e.g., SAFEqx('ls -1 $UserValue') will execute `ls -1 \'$UserValue\'`
#   with $UserValue interpolated. I recommend to use SAFEqx() instead
#   of backticks whenever you can. The OS shell scripts inside
#     
#   <SCRIPT TYPE="text/osshell">ls -1 $UserValue</SCRIPT> 
#   
#   are handeld by SAFEqx and automatically ''-quoted.
#
# 4 Logging of requests
#   All requests can be logged separate from the Host server. The level of
#   detail is user configurable: Including or excluding the actual queries. 
#   This allows for the inspection of (im-) proper use.
#
# 5 Access control: Clients
#   The Remote addresses can be checked against a list of authorized 
#   (i.e., accepted) or non-authorized (i.e., rejected) clients. Both 
#   REMOTE_HOST and REMOTE_ADDR are tested so clients without a proper 
#   HOST name can be (in-) excluded by their IP-address. Client patterns 
#   containing all numbers and dots are considered IP-addresses, all others
#   domain names. No wild-cards or regexp's are allowed, only partial 
#   addresses.
#   Matching of names is done from the back to the front (domain first, 
#   i.e., $REMOTE_HOST =~ /\Q$pattern\E$/is), so including ".edu" will 
#   accept or reject all clients from the domain EDU. Matching of 
#   IP-addresses is done from the front to the back (domain first, i.e., 
#   $REMOTE_ADDR =~ /^\Q$pattern\E/is), so including "128." will (in-) 
#   exclude all clients whose IP-address starts with 128.
#   There are two special symbols: "-" matches HOSTs with no name and "*"
#   matches ALL HOSTS/clients.
#   For those needing more expressional power, lines starting with 
#   "-e" are evaluated by the perl eval() function. E.g., 
#   '-e $REMOTE_HOST =~ /\.edu$/is;' will accept/reject clients from the 
#   domain '.edu'.
#
# 6 Access control: Files
#   In principle, CGIscriptor could read ANY file in the directory 
#   tree as discussed in 1. However, for security reasons this is 
#   restricted to text files. It can be made more restricted by entering 
#   a global file pattern (e.g., ".html"). This is done by default. 
#   For each client requesting access, the file pattern(s) can be made
#   more restrictive than the global pattern by entering client specific
#   file patterns in the Access Control files (see 5).
#   For example: if the ACCEPT file contained the lines
#   *           DEMO
#   .hum.uva.nl LET 
#   145.18.230.     
#   Then all clients could request paths containing "DEMO" or "demo", e.g. 
#   "/my/demo/file.html" ($PATH_INFO =~ /\Q$pattern\E/), Clients from 
#   *.hum.uva.nl could also request paths containing  "LET or "let", e.g. 
#   "/my/let/file.html", and clients from the local cluster 
#   145.18.230.[0-9]+ could access ALL files.
#   Again, for those needing more expressional power, lines starting with 
#   "-e" are evaluated. For instance: 
#   '-e $REMOTE_HOST =~ /\.edu$/is && $PATH_INFO =~ m@/DEMO/@is;' 
#   will accept/reject requests for files from the directory "/demo/" from
#   clients from the domain '.edu'.
# 
# 7 Access control: Server side session tickets
#   Specific paths can be controlled by Session Tickets which must be 
#   present as a SESSIONTICKET=<value> CGI variable in the request. These paths 
#   are defined in %TicketRequiredPatterns as pairs of:
#   ('regexp' => 'SessionPath\tPasswordPath\tLogin.html\tExpiration').
#   Session Tickets are stored in a separate directory (SessionPath, e.g., 
#   "Private/.Session") as files with the exact same name of the SESSIONTICKET 
#   CGI. The following is an example: 
#   Type: SESSION
#   IPaddress: 127.0.0.1
#   AllowedPaths: ^/Private/Name/
#   Expires: 3600
#   Username: test
#   ...
#   Other content can follow. 
#   
#   It is adviced that Session Tickets should be deleted 
#   after some (idle) time. The IP address should be the IP number at login, and
#   the SESSIONTICKET will be rejected if it is presented from another IP address.
#   AllowedPaths and DeniedPaths are perl regexps. Be careful how they match. Make sure to delimit 
#   the names to prevent access to overlapping names, eg, "^/Private/Rob" will also
#   match "^/Private/Robert", however, "^/Private/Rob/" will not. Expires is the
#   time the ticket will remain valid after creation (file ctime). Time can be given
#   in s[econds] (default), m[inutes], h[hours], or d[ays], eg, "24h" means 24 hours.
#   None of these need be present, but the Ticket must have a non-zero size.
#   
#   Next to Session Tickets, there are two other type of ticket files:
#   - LOGIN tickets store information about a current login request
#   - PASSWORD ticket store account information to authorize login requests
#   
# 8 Query length limiting
#   The length of the Query string can be limited. If CONTENT_LENGTH is larger
#   than this limit, the request is rejected. The combined length of the 
#   Query string and the POST input is checked before any processing is done. 
#   This will prevent clients from overloading the scripts.
#   The actual, combined, Query Size is accessible as a variable through 
#   $CGI_Content_Length.
#  
# 9 Illegal filenames, paths, and protected directories
#   One of the primary security concerns in handling CGI-scripts is the
#   use of "funny" characters in the requests that con scripts in executing
#   malicious commands. Examples are inserting ';', null bytes, or <newline> 
#   characters in URL's and filenames, followed by executable commands. A  
#   special variable $FileAllowedChars stores a string of all allowed
#   characters. Any request that translates to a filename with a character 
#   OUTSIDE this set will be rejected.
#   In general, all (readable files) in the DocumentRoot tree are accessible.
#   This might not be what you want. For instance, your DocumentRoot directory
#   might be the working directory of a CVS project and contain sensitive
#   information (e.g., the password to get to the repository). You can block
#   access to these subdirectories by adding the corresponding patterns to
#   the $BlockPathAccess variable. For instance, $BlockPathAccess = '/CVS/'
#   will block any request that contains '/CVS/' or: 
#   die if $BlockPathAccess && $ENV{'PATH_INFO'} =~ m@$BlockPathAccess@;
#  
#10 The execution of code blocks can be controlled in a transparent way
#   by adding IF or UNLESS conditions in the tags themselves. That is,
#   a simple check of the validity of filenames or email addresses can
#   be done before any code is executed.

#
# USER MANUAL (sort of)
#
# CGIscriptor removes embedded scripts, indicated by an HTML 4 type 
# <SCRIPT TYPE='text/ssperl'> </SCRIPT> or <SCRIPT TYPE='text/osshell'> 
# </SCRIPT> constructs. CGIscriptor also recognizes XML-type 
# <SCRIPT TYPE='text/ssperl'/> constructs. These are usefull when
# the necessary code is already available in the TAG itself (e.g.,
# using external files). The contents of the directive are executed by 
# the PERL eval() and `` functions (in a separate name space). The 
# result of the eval() function replaces the <SCRIPT> </SCRIPT> construct 
# in the output file. You can use the values that are delivered in 
# CGI-compliant form (i.e., the "?name=value&.." type URL additions) 
# transparently as "$name" variables in your directives after they are 
# defined in a <META> or <SCRIPT> tag. 
# If you define the variable "$CGIscriptorResults" in a CGI attribute, all 
# subsequent <SCRIPT> and <META> results (including the defining 
# tag) will also be pushed onto a stack: @CGIscriptorResults. This list 
# behaves like any other, ordinary list and can be manipulated.
#
# Both GET and POST requests are accepted. These two methods are treated
# equal. Variables, i.e., those values that are determined when a file is
# processed, are indicated in the CGI attribute by $<name> or $<name>=<default>
# in which  <name> is the name of the variable and <default> is the value
# used when there is NO current CGI value for <name> (you can use 
# white-spaces in $<name>=<default> but really DO make sure that the 
# default value is followed by white space or is quoted). Names can contain 
# any alphanumeric characters and _ (i.e., names match /[\w]+/).
# If the Content-type: is 'multipart/*', the input is treated as a
# MIME multipart message and automatically delimited. CGI variables get 
# the "raw" (i.e., undecoded) body of the corresponding message part. 
#
# Variables can be CGI variables, i.e., those from the QUERY_STRING, 
# environment variables, e.g., REMOTE_USER, REMOTE_HOST, or REMOTE_ADDR, 
# or predefined values, e.g., CGI_Decoded_QS (The complete, decoded, 
# query string), CGI_Content_Length (the length of the decoded query 
# string), CGI_Year, CGI_Month, CGI_Time, and CGI_Hour (the current 
# date and time).
# 
# All these are available when defined in a CGI attribute. All environment 
# variables are accessible as $ENV{'name'}. So, to access the REMOTE_HOST 
# and the REMOTE_USER, use, e.g.: 
# 
# <SCRIPT TYPE='text/ssperl'>
# ($ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'}||"-")." $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'}"
# </SCRIPT>
# 
# (This will print a "-" if REMOTE_HOST is not known)
# Another way to do this is:
# 
# <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI='$REMOTE_HOST = - $REMOTE_USER'">
# <SCRIPT TYPE='text/ssperl'>"$REMOTE_HOST $REMOTE_USER"</SCRIPT>
# or
# <META CONTENT='text/ssperl; CGI="$REMOTE_HOST = - $REMOTE_USER"
#  SRC={"$REMOTE_HOST $REMOTE_USER\n"}'>
#  
# This is possible because ALL environment variables are available as 
# CGI variables. The environment variables take precedence over CGI 
# names in case of a "name clash". For instance:  
# <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI='$HOME' SRC={$HOME}">
# Will print the current HOME directory (environment) irrespective whether
# there is a CGI variable from the query 
# (e.g., Where do you live? <INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="HOME">)
# THIS IS A SECURITY FEATURE. It prevents clients from changing
# the values of defined environment variables (e.g., by supplying
# a bogus $REMOTE_ADDR). Although $ENV{} is not changed by the META tags, 
# it would make the use of declared variables insecure. You can still 
# access CGI variables after a name clash with 
# CGIscriptor::CGIparseValue(<name>).
#
# Some CGI variables are present several times in the query string
# (e.g., from multiple selections). These should be defined as
# @VARIABLENAME=default in the CGI attribute. The list @VARIABLENAME
# will contain ALL VARIABLENAME values from the query, or a single
# default value. If there is an ENVIRONMENT variable of the
# same name, it will be used instead of the default AND the query
# values. The corresponding function is 
# CGIscriptor::CGIparseValueList(<name>)
# 
# CGI variables collected in a @VARIABLENAME list are unordered.
# When more structured variables are needed, a hash table can be used.
# A variable defined as %VARIABLE=default will collect all
# CGI-parameters whose name start with 'VARIABLE' in a hash table with
# the remainder of the name as a key. For instance, %PERSON will 
# collect PERSONname='John Doe', PERSONbirthdate='01 Jan 00', and
# PERSONspouse='Alice' into a hash table %PERSON such that $PERSON{'spouse'}
# equals 'Alice'. Any default value or environment value will be stored
# under the "" key. If there is an ENVIRONMENT variable of the same name, 
# it will be used instead of the default AND the query values. The 
# corresponding function is CGIscriptor::CGIparseValueHash(<name>)
# 
# This method of first declaring your environment and CGI variables
# before being able to use them in the scripts might seem somewhat 
# clumsy, but it protects you from inadvertedly printing out the values of 
# system environment variables when their names coincide with those used 
# in the CGI forms.  It also prevents "clients" from supplying CGI 
# parameter values for your private variables.
# THIS IS A SECURITY FEATURE!
#
#
# NON-HTML CONTENT TYPES
#
# Normally, CGIscriptor prints the standard "Content-type: text/html\n\n"
# message before anything is printed. This has been extended to include
# plain text (.txt) files, for which the Content-type (MIME type) 
# 'text/plain' is printed. In all other respects, text files are treated
# as HTML files (this can be switched off by removing '.txt' from the 
# $FilePattern variable) . When the content type should be something else, 
# e.g., with multipart files, use the $RawFilePattern (.xmr, see also next 
# item). CGIscriptor will not print a Content-type message for this file 
# type (which must supply its OWN Content-type message). Raw files must
# still conform to the <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> and <META> tag specifications.
# 
# 
# NON-HTML FILES
# 
# CGIscriptor is intended to process HTML and text files only. You can 
# create documents of any mime-type on-the-fly using "raw" text files, 
# e.g.,  with the .xmr extension. However, CGIscriptor will not process 
# binary files of any type, e.g., pictures or sounds. Given the sheer 
# number of formats, I do not have any intention to do so. However, 
# an escape route has been provided. You can construct a genuine raw 
# (.xmr) text file that contains the perl code to service any file type 
# you want. If the global $BinaryMapFile variable contains the path to 
# this file (e.g., /BinaryMapFile.xmr), this  file will be called 
# whenever an unsupported (non-HTML) file type is  requested. The path 
# to the requested binary file is stored in  $ENV('CGI_BINARY_FILE') 
# and can be used like any other CGI-variable. Servicing binary files 
# then becomes supplying the correct Content-type (e.g., print 
# "Content-type: image/jpeg\n\n";) and reading the file and writing it 
# to STDOUT (e.g., using sysread() and syswrite()).
# 
# 
# THE META TAG
# 
# All attributes of a META tag are ignored, except the 
# CONTENT='text/ssperl; CGI=" ... " [SRC=" ... "]' attribute. The string
# inside the quotes following the CONTENT= indication (white-space is
# ignored, "" '' `` (){}[]-quote pairs are allowed, plus their \ versions) 
# MUST start with any of the CGIscriptor mime-types (e.g.: text/ssperl or 
# text/osshell) and a comma or semicolon. 
# The quoted string following CGI= contains a white-space separated list 
# of declarations of the CGI (and Environment) values and default values 
# used when no CGI values are supplied by the query string.
#
# If the default value is a longer string containing special characters, 
# possibly spanning several lines, the string must be enclosed in quotes. 
# You may use any pair of quotes or brackets from the list '', "", ``, (), 
# [], or {} to distinguish default values (or preceded by \, e.g., \(...\) 
# is different from (...)). The outermost pair will always be used and any 
# other quotes inside the string are considered to be part of the string 
# value, e.g., 
#
# $Value = {['this'
# "and" (this)]} 
# will result in $Value getting the default value: ['this'
# "and" (this)]
# (NOTE that the newline is part of the default value!).
#
# Internally, for defining and initializing CGI (ENV) values, the META 
# and SCRIPT tags use the functions "defineCGIvariable($name, $default)" 
# (scalars) and "defineCGIvariableList($name, $default)" (lists). 
# These functions can be used inside scripts as 
# "CGIscriptor::defineCGIvariable($name, $default)" and
# "CGIscriptor::defineCGIvariableList($name, $default)".
# "CGIscriptor::defineCGIvariableHash($name, $default)".
#
# The CGI attribute will be processed exactly identical when used inside
# the <SCRIPT> tag. However, this use is not according to the 
# HTML 4.0 specifications of the W3C.
#
#
# THE DIV/INS TAGS
#
# There is a problem when constructing html files containing
# server-side perl scripts with standard HTML tools. These
# tools will refuse to process any text between <SCRIPT></SCRIPT>
# tags. This is quite annoying when you want to use large
# HTML templates where you will fill in values.
#
# For this purpose, CGIscriptor will read the neutral 
# <DIV CLASS="ssperl" ID="varname"></DIV> or
# <INS CLASS="ssperl" ID="varname"></INS>
# tag (in Cascading Style Sheet manner) Note that 
# "varname" has NO '$' before it, it is a bare name. 
# Any text between these <DIV ...></DIV> or 
# <INS ...></INS>tags will be assigned to '$varname' 
# as is (e.g., as a literal). 
# No processing or interpolation will be performed. 
# There is also NO nesting possible. Do NOT nest a
# </DIV> inside a <DIV></DIV>! Moreover, neither INS nor
# DIV tags do ensure a block structure in the final 
# rendering (i.e., no empty lines).
#
# Note that <DIV CLASS="ssperl" ID="varname"/>
# is handled the XML way. No content is processed,
# but varname is defined, and any SRC directives are
# processed.
#
# You can use $varname like any other variable name. 
# However, $varname is NOT a CGI variable and will be 
# completely internal to your script. There is NO 
# interaction between $varname and the outside world.
#
# To interpolate a DIV derived text, you can use:
# $varname =~ s/([\]])/\\\1/g; # Mark ']'-quotes
# $varname = eval("qq[$varname]"); # Interpolate all values
#
# The DIV tags will process IF, UNLESS, CGI and 
# SRC attributes. The SRC files will be pre-pended to the
# body text of the tag. SRC blocks are NOT executed.
#
# CONDITIONAL PROCESSING: THE 'IF' AND 'UNLESS' ATTRIBUTES
#
# It is often necessary to include code-blocks that should be executed
# conditionally, e.g., only for certain browsers or operating system.
# Furthermore, quite often sanity and security checks are necessary
# before user (form) data can be processed, e.g., with respect to
# email addresses and filenames.
#
# Checks added to the code are often difficult to find, interpret or 
# maintain and in general mess up the code flow. This kind of confussion 
# is dangerous. 
# Also, for many of the supported "foreign" scripting languages, adding 
# these checks is cumbersome or even impossible. 
#
# As a uniform method for asserting the correctness of "context", two 
# attributes are added to all supported tags: IF and UNLESS. 
# They both evaluate their value and block execution when the
# result is <FALSE> (IF) or <TRUE> (UNLESS) in Perl, e.g., 
# UNLESS='$NUMBER \> 100;' blocks execution if $NUMBER <= 100. Note that
# the backslash in the '\>' is removed and only used to differentiate 
# this conditional '>' from the tag-closing '>'. For symmetry, the
# backslash in '\<' is also removed. Inside these conditionals, 
# ~/ and ./ are expanded to their respective directory root paths.
#
# For example, the following tag will be ignored when the filename is 
# invalid:
#
# <SCRIPT TYPE='text/ssperl' CGI='$FILENAME' 
# IF='CGIscriptor::CGIsafeFileName($FILENAME);'>
# ...
# </SCRIPT>
#
# The IF and UNLESS values must be quoted. The same quotes are supported
# as with the other attributes. The SRC attribute is ignored when IF and 
# UNLESS block execution.
#
# NOTE: 'IF' and 'UNLESS' always evaluate perl code.
#
#
# THE MAGIC SOURCE ATTRIBUTE (SRC=)
# 
# The SRC attribute inside tags accepts a list of filenames and URL's
# separated by "," comma's (or ";" semicolons). 
# ALL the variable values defined in the CGI attribute are available 
# in @ARGV as if the file or block was executed from the command line, 
# in the exact order in which they were declared in the preceding CGI 
# attribute.
# 
# First, a SRC={}-block will be evaluated as if the code inside the 
# block was part of a <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> construct, i.e.,
# "print do { code };'';" or `code` (i.e., SAFEqx('code)). 
# Only a single block is evaluated. Note that this is processed less 
# efficiently than <SCRIPT> </SCRIPT> blocks. Type of evaluation 
# depends on the content-type: Perl for text/ssperl and OS shell for 
# text/osshell. For other mime types (scripting languages), anything in 
# the source block is put in front of the code block "inside" the tag.
#
# Second, executable files (i.e., -x filename != 0) are evaluated as:
# print `filename \'$ARGV[0]\' \'$ARGV[1]\' ...`
# That is, you can actually call executables savely from the SRC tag.
# 
# Third, text files that match the file pattern, used by CGIscriptor to
# check whether files should be processed ($FilePattern), are 
# processed in-line (i.e., recursively) by CGIscriptor as if the code
# was inserted in the original source file. Recursions, i.e., calling
# a file inside itself, are blocked. If you need them, you have to code
# them explicitely using "main::ProcessFile($file_path)".
# 
# Fourth, Perl text files (i.e., -T filename != 0) are evaluated as: 
# "do FileName;'';".
#
# Last, URL's (i.e., starting with 'HTTP://', 'FTP://', 'GOPHER://', 
# 'TELNET://', 'WHOIS://' etc.) are loaded
# and printed. The loading and handling of <BASE> and document header 
# is done by a command generated by main::GET_URL($URL [, 0]). You can enter your 
# own code (default is curl, wget, or snarf and some post-processing to add a <BASE> tag).
#
# There are two pseudo-file names: PREFIX and POSTFIX. These implement
# a switch from prefixing the SRC code/files (PREFIX, default) before the
# content of the tag to appending the code after the content of the tag
# (POSTFIX). The switches are done in the order in which the PREFIX and 
# POSTFIX labels are encountered. You can mix PREFIX and POSTFIX labels 
# in any order with the SRC files. Note that the ORDER of file execution 
# is determined for prefixed and postfixed files seperately.
#
# File paths can be preceded by the URL protocol prefix "file://". This
# is simply STRIPPED from the name.
# 
# Example:
# The request 
# "http://cgi-bin/Action_Forms.pl/Statistics/Sign_Test.html?positive=8&negative=22
# will result in printing "${SS_PUB}/Statistics/Sign_Test.html"
# With QUERY_STRING = "positive=8&negative=22"
#
# on encountering the lines:
# <META CONTENT="text/osshell; CGI='$positive=11 $negative=3'">
# <b><SCRIPT LANGUAGE=PERL TYPE="text/ssperl" SRC="./Statistics/SignTest.pl">
#  </SCRIPT></b><p>"
#
# This line will be processed as:
# "<b>`${SS_SCRIPT}/Statistics/SignTest.pl '8' '22'`</b><p>"
#
# In which "${SS_SCRIPT}/Statistics/SignTest.pl" is an executable script, 
# This line will end up printed as:
# "<b>p <= 0.0161</b><p>"
#
# Note that the META tag itself will never be printed, and is invisible to 
# the outside world.
#
# The SRC files in a DIV or INS tag will be added (pre-pended) to the body
# of the <DIV></DIV> tag. Blocks are NOT executed! If you do not 
# need any content, you can use the <DIV...../> format.
# 
# 
# THE CGISCRIPTOR ROOT DIRECTORIES ~/ AND ./
# 
# Inside <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> tags, filepaths starting 
# with "~/" are replaced by "$YOUR_HTML_FILES/", this way files in the 
# public directories can be accessed without direct reference to the 
# actual paths. Filepaths starting with "./" are replaced by 
# "$YOUR_SCRIPTS/" and this should only be used for scripts. 
#
# Note: this replacement can seriously affect Perl scripts. Watch
# out for constructs like $a =~ s/aap\./noot./g, use 
# $a =~ s@aap\.@noot.@g instead.
#
# CGIscriptor.pl will assign the values of $SS_PUB and $SS_SCRIPT
# (i.e., $YOUR_HTML_FILES and $YOUR_SCRIPTS) to the environment variables 
# $SS_PUB and $SS_SCRIPT. These can be accessed by the scripts that are 
# executed.
# Values not preceded by $, ~/, or ./ are used as literals 
#
#
# OS SHELL SCRIPT EVALUATION (CONTENT-TYPE=TEXT/OSSHELL)
#
# OS scripts are executed by a "safe" version of the `` operator (i.e., 
# SAFEqx(), see also below) and any output is printed. CGIscriptor will 
# interpolate the script and replace all user-supplied CGI-variables by 
# their ''-quoted values (actually, all variables defined in CGI attributes 
# are quoted). Other Perl variables are interpolated in a simple fasion, 
# i.e., $scalar by their value, @list by join(' ', @list), and %hash by 
# their name=value pairs. Complex references, e.g., @$variable, are all 
# evaluated in a scalar context. Quotes should be used with care. 
# NOTE: the results of the shell script evaluation will appear in the
# @CGIscriptorResults stack just as any other result.
# All occurrences of $@% that should NOT be interpolated must be 
# preceeded by a "\". Interpolation can be switched off completely by 
# setting $CGIscriptor::NoShellScriptInterpolation = 1
# (set to 0 or undef to switch interpolation on again)
# i.e.,
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">
# $CGIscriptor::NoShellScriptInterpolation = 1;
# </SCRIPT>
#
#
# RUN TIME TRANSLATION OF INPUT FILES
#
# Allows general and global conversions of files using Regular Expressions.
# Very handy (but costly) to rewrite legacy pages to a new format.
# Select files to use it on with 
# my $TranslationPaths = 'filepattern';
# This is costly. For efficiency, define:
# $TranslationPaths = ''; when not using translations.
# Accepts general regular expressions: [$pattern, $replacement]
#
# Define: 
# my $TranslationPaths = 'filepattern'; # Pattern matching PATH_INFO
# 
# push(@TranslationTable, ['pattern', 'replacement']);
# e.g. (for Ruby Rails):
# push(@TranslationTable, ['<%=', '<SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssruby">']);
# push(@TranslationTable, ['%>', '</SCRIPT>']);
#
# Runs:
# my $currentRegExp;
# foreach $currentRegExp (@TranslationTable)
# {
#     my ($pattern, $replacement) = @$currentRegExp;
#     $$text =~ s!$pattern!$replacement!msg;
# };
#
#
# EVALUATION OF OTHER SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
#
# Adding a MIME-type and an interpreter command to 
# %ScriptingLanguages automatically will catch any other 
# scripting language in the standard 
# <SCRIPT TYPE="[mime]"></SCRIPT> manner.
# E.g., adding: $ScriptingLanguages{'text/sspython'} = 'python';
# will actually execute the folowing code in an HTML page
# (ignore 'REMOTE_HOST' for the moment):
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/sspython">
# # A Python script
# x = ["A","real","python","script","Hello","World","and", REMOTE_HOST]
# print x[4:8] # Prints the list ["Hello","World","and", REMOTE_HOST]
# </SCRIPT>
#
# The script code is NOT interpolated by perl, EXCEPT for those 
# interpreters that cannot handle variables themselves.
# Currently, several interpreters are pre-installed: 
# 
# Perl test -  "text/testperl" => 'perl',  
# Python    -  "text/sspython" => 'python', 
# Ruby      -  "text/ssruby"   => 'ruby',  
# Tcl       -  "text/sstcl"    => 'tcl',    
# Awk       -  "text/ssawk"    => 'awk -f-',  
# Gnu Lisp  -  "text/sslisp"   => 'rep | tail +5 '.
#                                 "| egrep -v '> |^rep. |^nil\\\$'",      
# XLispstat -  "text/xlispstat" => 'xlispstat | tail +7 '.
#                                "| egrep -v '> \\\$|^NIL'",      
# Gnu Prolog-  "text/ssprolog" => 'gprolog',  
# M4 macro's-  "text/ssm4"     => 'm4',
# Born shell-  "text/sh"       => 'sh', 
# Bash      -  "text/bash"     => 'bash',
# C-shell   -  "text/csh"      => 'csh',
# Korn shell-  "text/ksh"      => 'ksh',
# Praat     -  "text/sspraat"    => "praat - | sed 's/Praat > //g'",            
# R         -  "text/ssr" => "R --vanilla --slave | sed 's/^[\[0-9\]*] //g'",   
# REBOL     -   "text/ssrebol" => 
#               "rebol --quiet|egrep -v '^[> ]* == '|sed 's/^\s*\[> \]* //g'", 
# PostgreSQL-  "text/postgresql" => 'psql 2>/dev/null',
# (psql)
#
# Note that the "value" of $ScriptingLanguages{mime} must be a command
# that reads Standard Input and writes to standard output. Any extra
# output of interactive interpreters (banners, echo's, prompts)
# should be removed by piping the output through 'tail', 'grep',
# 'sed', or even 'awk' or 'perl'.
#
# For access to CGI variables there is a special hashtable:
# %ScriptingCGIvariables. 
# CGI variables can be accessed in three ways. 
# 1. If the mime type is not present in %ScriptingCGIvariables, 
# nothing is done and the script itself should parse the relevant 
# environment variables.
# 2. If the mime type IS present in %ScriptingCGIvariables, but it's
# value is empty, e.g., $ScriptingCGIvariables{"text/sspraat"}  = '';,
# the script text is interpolated by perl. That is, all $var, @array,
# %hash, and \-slashes are replaced by their respective values.
# 3. In all other cases, the CGI and environment variables are added
# in front of the script according to the format stored in 
# %ScriptingCGIvariables. That is, the following (pseudo-)code is 
# executed for each CGI- or Environment variable defined in the CGI-tag:
# printf(INTERPRETER, $ScriptingCGIvariables{$mime}, $CGI_NAME, $CGI_VALUE);
#
# For instance, "text/testperl" => '$%s = "%s";' defines variable
# definitions for Perl, and "text/sspython" => '%s = "%s"' for Python
# (note that these definitions are not save, the real ones contain '-quotes).
# 
# THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR @VARIABLES, the (empty) $VARIABLES will be used
# instead.
#
# The $CGI_VALUE parameters are "shrubed" of all control characters
# and quotes (by &shrubCGIparameter($CGI_VALUE)) for the options 2 and 3. 
# Control characters are replaced by \0<octal ascii value> (the exception
# is \015, the newline, which is replaced by \n) and quotes 
# and backslashes by their HTML character
# value (' -> &#39; ` -> &#96; " -> &quot; \ -> &#92; & -> &amper;). 
# For example:
# if a client would supply the string value  (in standard perl, e.g., 
# \n means <newline>)
# "/dev/null';\nrm -rf *;\necho '"
# it would be processed as 
# '/dev/null&#39;;\nrm -rf *;\necho &#39;'
# (e.g., sh or bash would process the latter more according to your 
# intentions).
# If your intepreter requires different protection measures, you will
# have to supply these in %main::SHRUBcharacterTR (string => translation), 
# e.g., $SHRUBcharacterTR{"\'"} = "&#39;";
#
# Currently, the following definitions are used:
# %ScriptingCGIvariables = (
# "text/testperl" => "\$\%s = '\%s';",    # Perl          $VAR = 'value' (for testing)
# "text/sspython" => "\%s = '\%s'",       # Python        VAR = 'value'
# "text/ssruby"   => '@%s = "%s"',        # Ruby          @VAR = "value"
# "text/sstcl"    => 'set %s "%s"',       # TCL           set VAR "value"
# "text/ssawk"    => '%s = "%s";',        # Awk           VAR = "value"; 
# "text/sslisp"   => '(setq %s "%s")',    # Gnu lisp (rep) (setq VAR "value")
# "text/xlispstat"   => '(setq %s "%s")',         # Xlispstat (setq VAR "value")
# "text/ssprolog" => '',                  # Gnu prolog    (interpolated)
# "text/ssm4"     => "define(`\%s', `\%s')", # M4 macro's define(`VAR', `value')
# "text/sh"       => "\%s='\%s';",        # Born shell    VAR='value'; 
# "text/bash"     => "\%s='\%s';",        # Born again shell VAR='value';
# "text/csh"      => "\$\%s = '\%s';",    # C shell       $VAR = 'value';
# "text/ksh"      => "\$\%s = '\%s';",    # Korn shell    $VAR = 'value';
# "text/sspraat"  => '',                  # Praat         (interpolation) 
# "text/ssr"      => '%s <- "%s";',       # R             VAR <- "value";
# "text/ssrebol"  => '%s: copy "%s"',     # REBOL         VAR: copy "value"
# "text/postgresql" => '',                # PostgreSQL    (interpolation) 
# "" => ""
# );
#
# Four tables allow fine-tuning of interpreter with code that should be 
# added before and after each code block:
# 
# Code added before each script block
# %ScriptingPrefix = (
# "text/testperl" => "\# Prefix Code;",   # Perl script testing
# "text/ssm4"     =>  'divert(0)'         # M4 macro's (open STDOUT)
# );
# Code added at the end of each script block
# %ScriptingPostfix = (
# "text/testperl" => "\# Postfix Code;",  # Perl script testing
# "text/ssm4"     =>  'divert(-1)'        # M4 macro's (block STDOUT)
# );
# Initialization code, inserted directly after opening (NEVER interpolated)
# %ScriptingInitialization = (
# "text/testperl" => "\# Initialization Code;", # Perl script testing
# "text/ssawk"    => 'BEGIN {',                 # Server Side awk scripts
# "text/sslisp"   => '(prog1 nil ',             # Lisp (rep)
# "text/xlispstat"   => '(prog1 nil ',          # xlispstat
# "text/ssm4"     =>  'divert(-1)'              # M4 macro's (block STDOUT)
# );
# Cleanup code, inserted before closing (NEVER interpolated)
# %ScriptingCleanup = (
# "text/testperl" => "\# Cleanup Code;",  # Perl script testing
# "text/sspraat" => 'Quit',
# "text/ssawk"    => '};',        # Server Side awk scripts
# "text/sslisp"   =>  '(princ "\n" standard-output)).'   # Closing print to rep
# "text/xlispstat"   =>  '(print "" *standard-output*)).'   # Closing print to xlispstat
# "text/postgresql" => '\q',
# );
#
#
# The SRC attribute is NOT magical for these interpreters. In short,
# all code inside a source file or {} block is written verbattim
# to the interpreter. No (pre-)processing or executional magic is done.
#
# A serious shortcomming of the described mechanism for handling other
# (scripting) languages, with respect to standard perl scripts 
# (i.e., 'text/ssperl'), is that the code is only executed when 
# the pipe to the interpreter is closed. So the pipe has to be 
# closed at the end of each block. This means that the state of the 
# interpreter (e.g., all variable values) is lost after the closing of 
# the next </SCRIPT> tag. The standard 'text/ssperl' scripts retain 
# all values and definitions.
#
# APPLICATION MIME TYPES
#
# To ease some important auxilliary functions from within the
# html pages I have added them as MIME types. This uses
# the mechanism that is also used for the evaluation of
# other scripting languages, with interpolation of CGI
# parameters (and perl-variables). Actually, these are
# defined exactly like any other "scripting language".
#
# text/ssdisplay: display some (HTML) text with interpolated 
#                 variables (uses `cat`).
# text/sslogfile: write (append) the interpolated block to the file
#                 mentioned on the first, non-empty line
#                 (the filename can be preceded by 'File: ',
#                 note the space after the ':', 
#                 uses `awk .... >> <filename>`).
# text/ssmailto:  send email directly from within the script block. 
#                 The first line of the body must contain
#                 To:Name@Valid.Email.Address 
#                 (note: NO space between 'To:' and the email adres)
#                 For other options see the mailto man pages.
#                 It works by directly sending the (interpolated) 
#                 content of the text block to a pipe into the 
#                 Linux program 'mailto'.
#
# In these script blocks, all Perl variables will be 
# replaced by their values. All CGI variables are cleaned before 
# they are used. These CGI variables must be redefined with a 
# CGI attribute to restore their original values.
# In general, this will be more secure than constructing
# e.g., your own email command lines. For instance, Mailto will
# not execute any odd (forged) email addres, but just stops
# when the email address is invalid and awk will construct 
# any filename you give it (e.g. '<File;rm\\\040-f' would end up
# as a "valid" UNIX filename). Note that it will also gladly
# store this file anywhere (/../../../etc/passwd will work!).
# Use the CGIscriptor::CGIsafeFileName() function to clean the 
# filename.
#
# SHELL SCRIPT PIPING
# 
# If a shell script starts with the UNIX style "#! <shell command> \n"
# line, the rest of the shell script is piped into the indicated command, 
# i.e.,
# open(COMMAND, "| command");print COMMAND $RestOfScript; 
#
# In many ways this is equivalent to the MIME-type profiling for 
# evaluating other scripting languages as discussed above. The 
# difference breaks down to convenience. Shell script piping is a 
# "raw" implementation. It allows you to control all aspects of 
# execution. Using the MIME-type profiling is easier, but has a 
# lot of defaults built in that might get in the way. Another
# difference is that shell script piping uses the SAFEqx() function, 
# and MIME-type profiling does not.
# 
# Execution of shell scripts is under the control of the Perl Script blocks
# in the document. The MIME-type triggered execution of <SCRIPT></SCRIPT>
# blocks can be simulated easily. You can switch to a different shell, 
# e.g. tcl, completely by executing the following Perl commands inside 
# your document:
# 
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">
# $main::ShellScriptContentType = "text/ssTcl";     # Yes, you can do this
# CGIscriptor::RedirectShellScript('/usr/bin/tcl'); # Pipe to Tcl
# $CGIscriptor::NoShellScriptInterpolation = 1;
# </SCRIPT>
# 
# After this script is executed, CGIscriptor will parse scripts of
# TYPE="text/ssTcl" and pipe their contents into '|/usr/bin/tcl'
# WITHOUT interpolation (i.e., NO substitution of Perl variables).
# The crucial function is :
# CGIscriptor::RedirectShellScript('/usr/bin/tcl')
# After executing this function, all shell scripts AND all 
# calls to SAFEqx()) are piped into '|/usr/bin/tcl'. If the argument 
# of RedirectShellScript is empty, e.g., '', the original (default) 
# value is reset.
#  
# The standard output, STDOUT, of any pipe is send to the client. 
# Currently, you should be carefull with quotes in such a piped script.
# The results of a pipe is NOT put on the @CGIscriptorResults stack.
# As a result, you do not have access to the output of any piped (#!)
# process! If you want such access, execute 
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/osshell">echo "script"|command</SCRIPT> 
# or  
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">
# $resultvar = SAFEqx('echo "script"|command');
# </SCRIPT>.
#
# Safety is never complete. Although SAFEqx() prevents some of the 
# most obvious forms of attacks and security slips, it cannot prevent 
# them all. Especially, complex combinations of quotes and intricate 
# variable references cannot be handled safely by SAFEqx. So be on  
# guard.
#
#
# PERL CODE EVALUATION (CONTENT-TYPE=TEXT/SSPERL)
#
# All PERL scripts are evaluated inside a PERL package. This package 
# has a separate name space. This isolated name space protects the 
# CGIscriptor.pl program against interference from user code. However, 
# some variables, e.g., $_, are global and cannot be protected. You are 
# advised NOT to use such global variable names. You CAN write 
# directives that directly access the variables in the main program. 
# You do so at your own risk (there is definitely enough rope available 
# to hang yourself). The behavior of CGIscriptor becomes undefined if 
# you change its private variables during run time. The PERL code 
# directives are used as in: 
# $Result = eval($directive); print $Result;'';
# ($directive contains all text between <SCRIPT></SCRIPT>).
# That is, the <directive> is treated as ''-quoted string and
# the result is treated as a scalar. To prevent the VALUE of the code
# block from appearing on the client's screen, end the directive with 
# ';""</SCRIPT>'. Evaluated directives return the last value, just as 
# eval(), blocks, and subroutines, but only as a scalar.
#
# IMPORTANT: All PERL variables defined are persistent. Each <SCRIPT>
# </SCRIPT> construct is evaluated as a {}-block with associated scope
# (e.g., for "my $var;" declarations). This means that values assigned 
# to a PERL variable can be used throughout the document unless they
# were declared with "my". The following will actually work as intended 
# (note that the ``-quotes in this example are NOT evaluated, but used 
# as simple quotes):
# 
# <META CONTENT="text/ssperl; CGI=`$String='abcdefg'`">
# anything ...
# <SCRIPT TYPE=text/ssperl>@List = split('', $String);</SCRIPT>
# anything ...
# <SCRIPT TYPE=text/ssperl>join(", ", @List[1..$#List]);</SCRIPT>
# 
# The first <SCRIPT TYPE=text/ssperl></SCRIPT> construct will return the 
# value scalar(@List), the second <SCRIPT TYPE=text/ssperl></SCRIPT> 
# construct will print the elements of $String separated by commas, leaving 
# out the first element, i.e., $List[0].
#
# Another warning: './' and '~/' are ALWAYS replaced by the values of 
# $YOUR_SCRIPTS and $YOUR_HTML_FILES, respectively . This can interfere
# with pattern matching, e.g., $a =~ s/aap\./noot\./g will result in the
# evaluations of $a =~ s/aap\\${YOUR_SCRIPTS}noot\\${YOUR_SCRIPTS}g. Use 
# s@<regexp>.@<replacement>.@g instead.
#
#
# SERVER SIDE SESSIONS AND ACCESS CONTROL (LOGIN)
# 
# An infrastructure for user acount authorization and file access control
# is available. Each request is matched against a list of URL path patterns.
# If the request matches, a Session Ticket is required to access the URL.
# This Session Ticket should be present as a CGI parameter or Cookie, eg:
# 
# CGI: SESSIONTICKET=&lt;value&gt;
# Cookie: CGIscriptorSESSION=&lt;value&gt;
# 
# The example implementation stores Session Tickets as files in a local
# directory. To create Session Tickets, a Login request must be given 
# with a LOGIN=&lt;value&gt; CGI parameter, a user name and a (doubly hashed)
# password. The user name and (singly hashed) password are stored in a
# PASSWORD ticket with the same name as the user account (name cleaned up 
# for security).
# 
# The example session model implements 4 functions:
# - Login
#   The password is hashed with the user name and server side salt, and then 
#   hashed with the REMOTE_HOST and a random salt. Client and Server both 
#   perform these actions and the Server only grants access if restults are 
#   the same. The server side only stores the password hashed with the user
#   name and server side salt. Neither the plain password, nor the hashed
#   password is ever exchanged. Only values hashed with the one-time salt 
#   are exchanged.
# - Session
#   For every access to a restricted URL, the Session Ticket is checked before
#   access is granted. There are three session modes. The first uses a fixed
#   Session Ticket that is stored as a cookie value in the browser (actually, 
#   as a sessionStorage value). The second uses only the IP address at login
#   to authenticate requests. The third
#   is a Challenge mode, where the client has to calculate the value of the
#   next one-time Session Ticket from a value derived from the password and 
#   a random string.
# - Password Change
#   A new password is hashed with the user name and server side salt, and 
#   then encrypted (XORed)
#   with the old password hashed with the user name and salt. That value is 
#   exchanged and XORed with the stored old hashed(password+username+salt). 
#   Again, the stored password value is never exchanged unencrypted.
# - New Account
#   The text of a new account (Type: PASSWORD) file is constructed from 
#   the new username (CGI: NEWUSERNAME, converted to lowercase) and 
#   hashed new password (CGI: NEWPASSWORD). The same process is used to encrypt
#   the new password as is used for the Password Change function.
#   Again, the stored password value is never exchanged unencrypted.
#   Some default setting are encoded. For display in the browser, the new password
#   is reencrypted (XORed) with a special key, the old password hash 
#   hashed with a session specific random hex value sent initially with the
#   session login ticket ($RANDOMSALT).
#   For example for user "NewUser" and password "NewPassword" with filename 
#   "newuser":
# 
# Type: PASSWORD
# Username: newuser
# Password: 19afeadfba8d5dcd252e157fafd3010859f8762b87682b6b6cdb3e565194fa91
# IPaddress: 127\.0\.0\.1
# AllowedPaths: ^/Private/[\w\-]+\.html?
# AllowedPaths: ^/Private/newuser/
# Salt: e93cf858a1d5626bf095ea5c25df990dfa969ff5a5dc908b22c9a5229b525f65
# Session: SESSION
# Date: Fri Jun 29 12:46:22 2012
# Time: 1340973982
# Signature: 676c35d3aa63540293ea5442f12872bfb0a22665b504f58f804582493b6ef04e
# 
# The password is created with the commands:
# 
# printf '%s' 'NewPasswordnewuser970e68017413fb0ea84d7fe3c463077636dd6d53486910d4a53c693dd4109b1a'|shasum -a 256
# 
# If the CPAN mudule Digest is installed, it is used instead of the commands.
# However, the password account files are protected against unauthorized change. 
# To obtain a valid Password account, the following command should be given:
# 
# perl CGIscriptor.pl --managelogin salt=Private/.Passwords/SALT \
#   masterkey='Sherlock investigates oleander curry in Bath' \
#   password='NewPassword' \
#   Private/.Passwords/newuser
# 
# 
# Implementation
# 
# The session authentication mechanism is based on the exchange of ticket
# identifiers. A ticket identifier is just a string of characters, a name 
# or a random 64 character hexadecimal string. Authentication is based 
# on a (password derived) shared secret and the ability to calculate ticket
# identifiers from this shared secret. Ticket identifiers should be
# "safe" filenames (except user names). There are four types of tickets:
# PASSWORD: User account descriptors, including a user name and password
# LOGIN: Temporary anonymous tickets used during login
# IPADDRESS: Authentication tokens that allow access based on the IP address of the request
# SESSION: Reusable authentication tokens
# CHALLENGE: One-time authentication tokens
# All tickets can have an expiration date in the form of a time duration 
# from creation, in seconds, minutes, hours, or days (+duration[smhd]).
# An absolute time can be given in seconds since the epoch of the server host.
# Note that expiration times of CHALLENGE authentication tokens are calculated 
# from the last access time. Accounts can include a maximal lifetime 
# for session tickets (MaxLifetime).
# 
# A Login page should create a LOGIN ticket file locally and send a
# server specific salt, a Random salt, and a LOGIN ticket 
# identifier. The server side compares the username and hashed password, 
# actually hashed(hashed(password+serversalt)+Random salt) from the client with 
# the values it calculates from the stored Random salt from the LOGIN 
# ticket and the hashed(password+serversalt) from the PASSWORD ticket. If 
# successful, a new SESSION ticket is generated as a (double) hash sum of the stored 
# password and the LOGIN ticket, i.e. 
# LoginTicket = hashed(hashed(password+serversalt)+REMOTE_HOST + Random salt) and
# SessionTicket = hashed(hashed(LoginTicket).LoginTicket). This SESSION 
# ticket should also be generated by the client and stored as 
# sessionStorage and cookie values as needed. The Username, IP address 
# and Path are available as $LoginUsername, $LoginIPaddress, and 
# $LoginPath, respectively.
# 
# The CHALLENGE protocol stores the single hashed version of the SESSION tickets. 
# However, this value is not exchanged, but kept secret in the JavaScript
# sessionStorage object. Instead, every page returned from the 
# server will contain a one-time Challenge value ($CHALLENGETICKET) which 
# has to be hashed with the stored value to return the current ticket
# id string.
# 
# In the current example implementation, all random values are created as
# full, 256 bit SHA256 hash values (Hex strings) of 64 bytes read from 
# /dev/urandom.
# 
# 
# Authorization
# 
# A limited level of authorization tuning is build into the login system. 
# Each account file (PASSWORD ticket file) can contain a number of 
# Capabilities lines. These control special priveliges. The
# Capabilities can be checked inside the HTML pages as part of the
# ticket information. Two privileges are handled internally: 
# CreateUser and VariableREMOTE_ADDR. 
# CreateUser allows the logged in user to create a new user account. 
# With VariableREMOTE_ADDR, the session of the logged in user is 
# not limited to the Remote IP address from which the inital log-in took 
# place. Sessions can hop from one apparant (proxy) IP address to another, 
# e.g., when using Tor. Any IPaddress patterns given in the PASSWORD 
# ticket file remain in effect during the session. For security reasons, 
# the VariableREMOTE_ADDR capability is only effective if the session 
# type is CHALLENGE.
# 
# 
# Security considerations with Session tickets
#
# For strong security, please use end-to-end encryption. This can be 
# achieved using a VPN (Virtual Private Network), SSH tunnel, or a HTTPS 
# capable server with OpenSSL. The session ticket system of CGIscriptor.pl 
# is intended to be used as a simple authentication mechanism WITHOUT
# END-TO-END ENCRYPTION. The authenticating mechanism tries to use some
# simple means to protect the authentication process from eavesdropping.
# For this it uses a secure hash function, SHA256. For all practial purposes,
# it is impossible to "decrypt" a SHA256 sum. But this login scheme is
# only as secure as your browser. Which, in general, is not very secure.
# 
# One fundamental weakness of the implemented procedure is that the Client
# obtains the code to encrypt the passwords from the server. It is the JavaScript 
# code in the HTML pages. An attacker who could place himself between Server 
# and Client, a man in the middle attack (MITM), could change the code to 
# reveal the plaintext password and other information. There is no 
# real protection against this attack without end-to-end encryption and 
# authentication. A simple, but rather cumbersome, way to check for such 
# attacks would be to store known good copys of the pages (downloaded 
# with a browser or automatically with curl or wget) and 
# then use other tools to download new pages at random intervals and compare
# them to the old pages. For instance, the following line would remove 
# the variable ticket codes and give a fixed SHA256 sum for the original 
# Login.html page+code:
#  curl http://localhost:8080/Private/index.html | \
#       sed 's/=\"[a-z0-9]\{64\}\"/=""/g' | shasum -a 256
# A simple diff command between old and new files should give only 
# differences in half a dozen lines, where only hexadecimal salt values 
# will actually differ.
# 
# A sort of solution for the MITM attack problem that might protect at
# least the plaintext password would be to run a trusted web
# page from local storage to handle password input. The solution would be
# to add a hidden iFrame tag loading the untrusted page from the URL and
# extract the needed ticket and salt values. Then run the stored, trusted,
# code with these values. It is not (yet) possible to set the
# required session storage inside the browser, so this method only works
# for IPADDRESS sessions and plain SESSION tickets. There are many 
# security problems with this "solution".
#
# If you are able to ascertain the integrity of the login page using any
# of the above methods, you can check whether the IP address seen by the
# login server is indeed the IP address of your computer. The IP address
# of the REMOTE_HOST (your visible IP address) is part of the login 
# "password". It is stored in the login page as a CLIENTIPADDRESS. It can 
# can be inspected by clicking the "Check IP address" box. Provided the
# MitM attacker cannot spoof your IP address, you can ensure that the login
# server sees your IP address and not that of an attacker.
# 
# Humans tend to reuse passwords. A compromise of a site running 
# CGIscriptor.pl could therefore lead to a compromise of user accounts at 
# other sites. Therefore, plain text passwords are never stored, used, or 
# exchanged. Instead, the plain password and user name are "encrypted" with 
# a server site salt value. Actually, all are concatenated and hashed 
# with a one-way secure hash function (SHA256) into a single string. 
# Whenever the word "password" is used, this hash sum is meant. Note that
# the salts are generated from /dev/urandom. You should check whether the
# implementation of /dev/urandom on your platform is secure before 
# relying on it. This might be a problem when running CGIscriptor under 
# Cygwin on MS Windows.
# Note: no attempt is made to slow down the password hash, so bad
# passwords can be cracked by brute force
# 
# As the (hashed) passwords are all that is needed to identify at the site,
# these should not be stored in this form. A site specific passphrase
# can be entered as an environment variable ($ENV{'CGIMasterKey'}). This
# phrase is hashed with the server site salt and the result is hashed with
# the user name and then XORed with the password when it is stored. Also, to
# detect changes to the account (PASSWORD) and session tickets, a 
# (HMAC) hash of some of the contents of the ticket with the server salt and 
# CGIMasterKey is stored in each ticket.
# 
# Creating a valid (hashed) password, encrypt it with the CGIMasterKey and
# construct a signature of the ticket are non-trivial. This has to be redone
# with every change of the ticket file or CGIMasterKey change. CGIscriptor 
# can do this from the command line with the command:
# 
# perl CGIscriptor.pl --managelogin salt=Private/.Passwords/SALT \
#   masterkey='Sherlock investigates oleander curry in Bath' \
#   password='There is no password like more password' \
#   admin
# 
# CGIscriptor will exit after this command with the first option being 
# --managelogin. Options have the form:
# 
# salt=[file or string] 
#     Server salt value to use io the value 
#     stored in the ticket file. Will replace the stored value if a new
#     password is given. If you change the server salt, you have to
#     reset all the passwords. There is absolutely no procedure known
#     to recover plaintext passwords, except asking the account holders.
#     You are strongly adviced to make a backup before you apply such a change
# masterkey=[file or string] 
#     CGIMasterKey used to read and decrypt the ticket
# newmasterkey=[file or string]
#     CGIMasterKey used to encrypt, sign, 
#     and write the ticket. Defaults to the masterkey. If you change
#     the masterkey, you will have to reset all the accounts. You are strongly 
#     adviced to make a backup before you apply such a change
# password=[file or string]
#     New plaintext password
# 
# When the value of an option is a existing file path, the first line of 
# that file is used. Options are followed by one or more paths plus names 
# of existing ticket files. Each password option is only used for a single 
# ticket file. It is most definitely a bad idea to use a password that is 
# identical to an existing filepath, as the file will be read instead. Be
# aware that the name of the file should be a cleaned up version of the
# Username. This will not be checked.
# 
# For the authentication and a change of password, the (old) password 
# is used to "encrypt" a random one-time token or the new password, 
# respectively. For authentication, decryption is not needed, so a secure 
# hash function (SHA256) is used to create a one-way hash sum "encryption". 
# A new password must be decrypted. New passwords are encryped by XORing 
# them with the old password.
# 
# Strong Passwords: It is so easy
# If you only could see what you are typing
# 
# Your password might be vulnerable to brute force guessing
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_force_attack). 
# Protections against such attacks are costly in terms of code 
# complexity, bugs, and execution time. However, there is a very 
# simple and secure counter measure. See the XKCD comic 
# (http://xkcd.com/936/). The phrase, "There is no password like more 
# password" would be both much easier to remember, and still stronger 
# than "h4]D%@m:49", at least before this phrase was pasted as an 
# example on the Internet. 
# 
# For the procedures used at this site, a basic computer setup can 
# check in the order of a billion passwords per second. You need a 
# password (or phrase) strength in the order of 56 bits to be a 
# little secure (one year on a single computer). Please be so kind 
# and add the name of your favorite flower, dish, fictional 
# character, or small town to your password. Say, Oleander, Curry, 
# Sherlock, or Bath, UK (each adds ~12 bits) or even the phrase "Sherlock 
# investigates oleander curry in Bath" (adds > 56 bits, note that 
# oleander is poisonous, so do not try this curry at home). That 
# would be more effective than adding a thousand rounds of encryption.
# Typing long passwords without seeing what you are typing is 
# problematic. So a button should be included to make password 
# visible. 
#
#
# Technical matters
# 
# Client side JavaScript code definitions. Variable names starting with '$'
# are CGIscriptor CGI variables. Some of the hashes could be strengthened
# by switching to HMAC signatures. However, the security issues of
# maintaining parallel functions for HMAC in both Perl and Javascript seem
# to be  more serious than the attack vectors against the hashes. But HMAC
# is indeed used for the ticket signatures.

# USER EXTENSIONS
#
# A CGIscriptor package is attached to the bottom of this file. With
# this package you can personalize your version of CGIscriptor by 
# including often used perl routines. These subroutines can be 
# accessed by prefixing their names with CGIscriptor::, e.g., 
# <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=PERL TYPE=text/ssperl> 
# CGIscriptor::ListDocs("/Books/*") # List all documents in /Books
# </SCRIPT>
# It already contains some useful subroutines for Document Management.
# As it is a separate package, it has its own namespace, isolated from
# both the evaluator and the main program. To access variables from
# the document <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> blocks, use $CGIexecute::<var>. 
# 
# Currently, the following functions are implemented 
# (precede them with CGIscriptor::, see below for more information)
# - SAFEqx ('String') -> result of qx/"String"/ # Safe application of ``-quotes
#   Is used by text/osshell Shell scripts. Protects all CGI 
#   (client-supplied) values with single quotes before executing the 
#   commands (one of the few functions that also works WITHOUT CGIscriptor:: 
#   in front)
# - defineCGIvariable ($name[, $default) -> 0/1 (i.e., failure/success)
#   Is used by the META tag to define and initialize CGI and ENV 
#   name/value pairs. Tries to obtain an initializing value from (in order):
#   $ENV{$name}
#   The Query string
#   The default value given (if any)
#   (one of the few functions that also works WITHOUT CGIscriptor:: 
#   in front)
# - CGIsafeFileName (FileName) -> FileName or ""
#   Check a string against the Allowed File Characters (and ../ /..).
#   Returns an empty string for unsafe filenames.
# - CGIsafeEmailAddress (Email) -> Email or ""
#   Check a string against correct email address pattern.
#   Returns an empty string for unsafe addresses.
# - RedirectShellScript ('CommandString') -> FILEHANDLER or undef
#   Open a named PIPE for SAFEqx to receive ALL shell scripts
# - URLdecode (URL encoded string) -> plain string # Decode URL encoded argument
# - URLencode (plain string) -> URL encoded string # Encode argument as URL code
# - CGIparseValue (ValueName [, URL_encoded_QueryString]) -> Decoded value
#   Extract the value of a CGI variable from the global or a private 
#   URL-encoded query (multipart POST raw, NOT decoded)
# - CGIparseValueList (ValueName [, URL_encoded_QueryString]) 
#   -> List of decoded values
#   As CGIparseValue, but now assembles ALL values of ValueName into a list.
# - CGIparseHeader (ValueName [, URL_encoded_QueryString]) -> Header
#   Extract the header of a multipart CGI variable from the global or a private 
#   URL-encoded query ("" when not a multipart variable or absent)
# - CGIparseForm ([URL_encoded_QueryString]) -> Decoded Form
#   Decode the complete global URL-encoded query or a private 
#   URL-encoded query
# - read_url(URL) # Returns the page from URL (with added base tag, both FTP and HTTP)
#   Uses main::GET_URL(URL, 1) to get at the command to read the URL.
# - BrowseDirs(RootDirectory [, Pattern, Startdir, CGIname]) # print browsable directories
# - ListDocs(Pattern [,ListType])  # Prints a nested HTML directory listing of 
#   all documents, e.g., ListDocs("/*", "dl");.
# - HTMLdocTree(Pattern [,ListType])  # Prints a nested HTML listing of all 
#   local links starting from a given document, e.g., 
#   HTMLdocTree("/Welcome.html", "dl");
#
#
# THE RESULTS STACK: @CGISCRIPTORRESULTS
# 
# If the pseudo-variable "$CGIscriptorResults" has been defined in a
# META tag, all subsequent SCRIPT and META results are pushed 
# on the @CGIscriptorResults stack. This list is just another
# Perl variable and can be used and manipulated like any other list.
# $CGIscriptorResults[-1] is always the last result.
# This is only of limited use, e.g., to use the results of an OS shell
# script inside a Perl script. Will NOT contain the results of Pipes
# or code from MIME-profiling.
#
#
# USEFULL CGI PREDEFINED VARIABLES (DO NOT ASSIGN TO THESE)
#
# $CGI_HOME - The DocumentRoot directory
# $CGI_Decoded_QS - The complete decoded Query String
# $CGI_Content_Length - The ACTUAL length of the Query String
# $CGI_Date - Current date and time
# $CGI_Year $CGI_Month $CGI_Day $CGI_WeekDay - Current Date
# $CGI_Time - Current Time

# $CGI_GMTHour $CGI_GMTMinutes $CGI_GMTSeconds $CGI_GMTisdst
# 
#
# USEFULL CGI ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#
# Variables accessible (in APACHE) as $ENV{<name>}
# (see: "http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html"):
#
# QUERY_STRING - The query part of URL, that is, everything that follows the 
#                question mark.
# PATH_INFO    - Extra path information given after the script name
# PATH_TRANSLATED - Extra pathinfo translated through the rule system. 
#                   (This doesn't always make sense.)
# REMOTE_USER  - If the server supports user authentication, and the script is 
#                protected, this is the username they have authenticated as.
# REMOTE_HOST  - The hostname making the request. If the server does not have 
#                this information, it should set REMOTE_ADDR and leave this unset
# REMOTE_ADDR  - The IP address of the remote host making the request.
# REMOTE_IDENT - If the HTTP server supports RFC 931 identification, then this 
#                variable will be set to the remote user name retrieved from 
#                the server. Usage of this variable should be limited to logging 
#                only. 
# AUTH_TYPE    - If the server supports user authentication, and the script 
#                is protected, this is the protocol-specific authentication 
#                method used to validate the user. 
# CONTENT_TYPE - For queries which have attached information, such as HTTP 
#                POST and PUT, this is the content type of the data.   
# CONTENT_LENGTH - The length of the said content as given by the client.
# SERVER_SOFTWARE - The name and version of the information server software 
#                   answering the request (and running the gateway). 
#                   Format: name/version
# SERVER_NAME  - The server's hostname, DNS alias, or IP address as it 
#                   would appear in self-referencing URLs
# GATEWAY_INTERFACE - The revision of the CGI specification to which this 
#                     server complies. Format: CGI/revision
# SERVER_PROTOCOL - The name and revision of the information protocol this 
#                   request came in with. Format: protocol/revision
# SERVER_PORT  - The port number to which the request was sent.
# REQUEST_METHOD - The method with which the request was made. For HTTP, 
#                  this is "GET", "HEAD", "POST", etc. 
# SCRIPT_NAME  - A virtual path to the script being executed, used for 
#                self-referencing URLs.
# HTTP_ACCEPT  - The MIME types which the client will accept, as given by 
#                HTTP headers. Other protocols may need to get this 
#                information from elsewhere. Each item in this list should 
#                be separated by commas as per the HTTP spec. 
#                Format: type/subtype, type/subtype  
# HTTP_USER_AGENT - The browser the client is using to send the request. 
#                General format: software/version library/version. 
#
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING CGIscriptor ON UNIX
# 
# CGIscriptor.pl will run on any WWW server that runs Perl scripts, just add
# a line like the following to your srm.conf file (Apache example):
# 
# ScriptAlias /SHTML/ /real-path/CGIscriptor.pl/
# 
# URL's that refer to http://www.your.address/SHTML/...  will now be handled
# by CGIscriptor.pl, which can use a private directory tree (default is the
# DOCUMENT_ROOT directory tree, but it can be anywhere, see manual).
# 
# If your hosting ISP won't let you add ScriptAlias lines you can use
# the following "rewrite"-based "scriptalias" in .htaccess
# (from Gerd Franke)
# 
# 	RewriteEngine 	On
# 	RewriteBase  /
# 	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} .html$
# 	RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME}	!cgiscriptor.pl$
# 	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}	-f
# 	RewriteRule	^(.*)$	/cgi-bin/cgiscriptor.pl/$1?&%{QUERY_STRING}
# 
# Everthing with the extension ".html" and not including "cgiscriptor.pl" 
# in the url and where the file "path/filename.html" exists is redirected 
# to "/cgi.bin/cgiscriptor.pl/path/filename.html?query".
# The user configuration should get the same path-level as the 
# .htaccess-file:
# 
# # Just enter your own directory path here
# $YOUR_HTML_FILES = "$ENV{'DOCUMENT_ROOT'}";     
# # use DOCUMENT_ROOT only, if .htaccess lies in the root-directory.
# 
# If this .htaccess goes in a specific directory, the path to this 
# directory must be added to $ENV{'DOCUMENT_ROOT'}.
#
# The CGIscriptor file contains all documentation as comments.  These
# comments can be removed to speed up loading (e.g., `egrep -v '^#'
# CGIscriptor.pl` > leanScriptor.pl).  A bare bones version of
# CGIscriptor.pl, lacking documentation, most comments, access control,
# example functions etc.  (but still with the copyright notice and some
# minimal documentation) can be obtained by calling CGIscriptor.pl on the 
# command line with the '-slim' command line argument, e.g.,
# 
# >CGIscriptor.pl -slim > slimCGIscriptor.pl
# 
# CGIscriptor.pl can be run from the command line with <path> and <query> as
# arguments, as `CGIscriptor.pl  <path> <query>`, inside a perl script 
# with 'do CGIscriptor.pl' after setting $ENV{PATH_INFO}
# and $ENV{QUERY_STRING}, or CGIscriptor.pl can be loaded with 'require
# "/real-path/CGIscriptor.pl"'.  In the latter case, requests are processed
# by 'Handle_Request();' (again after setting $ENV{PATH_INFO} and
# $ENV{QUERY_STRING}).
# 
# Using the command line execution option, CGIscriptor.pl can be used as a 
# document (meta-)preprocessor. If the first argument is '-', STDIN will be read. 
# For example:
# 
# > cat MyDynamicDocument.html | CGIscriptor.pl - '[QueryString]' > MyStaticFile.html
# 
# This command line will produce a STATIC file with the DYNAMIC content of 
# MyDocument.html "interpolated". 
#
# This option would be very dangerous when available over the internet. 
# If someone could sneak a 'http://www.your.domain/-' URL past your 
# server, CGIscriptor could EXECUTE any POSTED contend.
# Therefore, for security reasons, STDIN will NOT be read
# if ANY of the HTTP server environment variables is set (e.g.,
# SERVER_PORT, SERVER_PROTOCOL, SERVER_NAME, SERVER_SOFTWARE, 
# HTTP_USER_AGENT, REMOTE_ADDR).
# This block on processing STDIN on HTTP requests can be lifted by setting
# $BLOCK_STDIN_HTTP_REQUEST = 0;
# In the security configuration. Butbe carefull when doing this. 
# It can be very dangerous.
#
# Running demo's and more information can be found at
# http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/~rob/OSS/OSS.html
# 
# A pocket-size HTTP daemon, CGIservlet.pl, is available from my web site or
# CPAN that can use CGIscriptor.pl as the base of a µWWW server and
# demonstrates its use.
# 
#
# PROCESSING NON-FILESYSTEM DATA
#
# Normally, HTTP (WWW) requests map onto file that can be accessed
# using the perl open() function. That is, the web server runs on top of
# some directory structure. However, we can envission (and put to good
# use) other systems that do not use a normal file system. The whole CGI
# was developed to make dynamic document generation possible. 
#
# A special case is where we want to have it both: A normal web server
# with normal "file data", but not a normal files system. For instance,
# we want or normal Web Site to run directly from a RAM hash table or
# other database, instead of from disk. But we do NOT want to code the
# whole site structure in CGI.
#
# CGIscriptor can do this. If the web server fills an environment variable
# $ENV{'CGI_FILE_CONTENT'} with the content of the "file", then the content 
# of this variable is processed instead of opening a file. If this environment 
# variable has the value '-', the content of another environment variable,
# $ENV{'CGI_DATA_ACCESS_CODE'} is executed as:
# eval("\@_ = ($file_path); do {$ENV{'CGI_DATA_ACCESS_CODE'}};") 
# and the result is processed as if it was the content of the requested
# file.
# (actually, the names of the environment variables are user configurable, 
# they are stored in the local variables $CGI_FILE_CONTENT and 
# $CGI_DATA_ACCESS_CODE)
#
# When using this mechanism, the SRC attribute mechanism will only partially work.
# Only the "recursive" calls to CGIscriptor (the ProcessFile() function) 
# will work, the automagical execution of SRC files won't. (In this case, 
# the SRC attribute won't work either for other scripting languages)
#
#
# NON-UNIX PLATFORMS
# 
# CGIscriptor.pl was mainly developed and tested on UNIX. However, as I 
# coded part of the time on an Apple Macintosh under MacPerl, I made sure
# CGIscriptor did run under MacPerl (with command line options).  But only
# as an independend script, not as part of a HTTP server. I have used it
# under Apache in Windows XP.

#
# A special function that is a safe alternative to backtick quotes (and qx//)
# with client-supplied CGI values. All CGI variables are surrounded by
# single ''-quotes (except between existing \'\'-quotes, don't try to be
# too smart). All variables are then interpolated. Simple (@) lists are 
# expanded with join(' ', @List), and simple (%) hash tables expanded 
# as a list of "key=value" pairs. Complex variables, e.g., @$var, are
# evaluated in a scalar context (e.g., as scalar(@$var)). All occurrences of
# $@% that should NOT be interpolated must be preceeded by a "\".
# If the first line of the String starts with "#! interpreter", the 
# remainder of the string is piped into interpreter (after interpolation), i.e.,
# open(INTERPRETER, "|interpreter");print INTERPRETER remainder;
# just like in UNIX. There are  some problems with quotes. Be carefull in
# using them. You do not have access to the output of any piped (#!)
# process! If you want such access, execute 
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/osshell">echo "script"|interpreter</SCRIPT> or  
# <SCRIPT TYPE="text/ssperl">$resultvar = SAFEqx('echo "script"|interpreter');

#
# The following subroutine is very usefull for checking large document
# trees. Starting from the root (s), it reads all files and prints out
# a nested list of links to all attached files. Non-existing or misplaced
# files are flagged. This is quite a file-i/o intensive routine
# so you would not like it to be accessible to everyone. If you want to
# use the result, save the whole resulting page to disk and use a link
# to this file. 
#
# HTMLdocTree takes an HTML file or file pattern and constructs nested lists 
# with links to *local* files (i.e., only links to the local server are
# followed). The list entries are the document titles.
# If the list type is <dl>, the first <H1> header is used too.
# For each file matching the pattern, a list is made recursively of all
# HTML documents that are linked from it and are stored in the same directory
# or a sub-directory. Warnings are given for missing files.
# The listing starts for the ServerRoot directory.
# You can change the default list type <dl> (<dl>, <ul>, <ol>).

=head1 NAME

CGIscriptor - 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A flexible HTML 4 compliant script/module for CGI-aware
embeded Perl, shell-scripts, and other scripting languages, 
executed at the server side.   

=head1 README

Executes embeded Perl code in HTML pages with easy 
access to CGI variables. Also processes embeded shell 
scripts and scripts in any other language with an 
interactive interpreter (e.g., in-line Python, Tcl, 
Ruby, Awk, Lisp, Xlispstat, Prolog, M4, R, REBOL, Praat, 
sh, bash, csh, ksh).

CGIscriptor is very flexible and hides all the specifics 
and idiosyncrasies of correct output and CGI coding and naming. 
CGIscriptor complies with the W3C HTML 4.0 recommendations.

This Perl program will run on any WWW server that runs 
Perl scripts, just add a line like the following to your 
srm.conf file (Apache example):

ScriptAlias /SHTML/ /real-path/CGIscriptor.pl/

URL's that refer to http://www.your.address/SHTML/... will 
now be handled by CGIscriptor.pl, which can use a private 
directory tree (default is the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory tree, 
but it can be anywhere).
